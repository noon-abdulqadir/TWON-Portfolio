            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">You now have finished the survey.
                Thank
                you
                very much for your
                participation.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">The goal of this study was to examine
                the
                combined effects of
                gender stereotypes in job advertisements and AI-based recruitment tools’
                recommendations
                on
                hiring decisions. Thus, the job advertisements as well as the candidate profiles you
                were
                asked to evaluate were altered to test these effects.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">We asked you to select a candidate to
                be
                hired
                using a
                specialized digital hiring platform where you are presented with a job advertisement
                and
                condensed candidate profiles. The platform aided in making hiring decisions by
                highlighting
                important words and phrases in both texts. For some participants, an AI-based
                recruitment
                tool and a diversity cue recommended a candidate. Although what you saw was designed
                by
                researchers for the purpose of the present study, similar automated and AI-based
                hiring
                tools are rapidly becoming a mainstay of hiring and recruitment (HR) processes. More
                companies are adopting these technologies, with IBM finding a 19% usage in IT firms.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">As these tools become part of hiring
                processes, the public has
                an interest in learning the tools’ effects on HR practices and hiring
                decision-making.
                Indeed, the use of these tools in HR can have both positive and negative effects.
                However,
                due to their novelty and potential to impact economic opportunities, researchers
                must
                disentangle the tools’ influences and aid informed, measured responses in light of
                social
                and legal implications. We thank you for helping further research in this area.</p>
