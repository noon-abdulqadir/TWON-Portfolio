# Codebook Construction Procedure for Bias in Candidate Sourcing Communication Project

As discussed, codebook construction aimed to produce single measures capturing latent warmth- and competence-related frames. Two methods aided this: (1) a small-scale systematic literature review (see Table below for list of words obtained from the literature review), and (2) a word embedding analysis using Word2Vec conducted on a small sample of the collected job ads; *n*=200. These methods served to familiarize coders with warmth- and competence-related concepts and terms in job ads. In line with holistic singular assessment coding procedure, a close reading of 15 job ads with varying formats was conducted to familiarize the primary coders with the shared features of online job ads in relation to warmth- and competence-related framing. Two secondary coders were then trained on sample job ads for two weeks and the rationale for coding decisions was discussed for codebook refinement. The codebook included typical and atypical example sentences along with rationale for coding decisions.
