# Codebook for Bias in Candidate Sourcing Communication Project

This study aims to look at the framing of job advertisements from different occupational sectors in the Dutch labor market. Particularly, we examine whether the framing of job advertisements conveys certain characteristics in relation to the company, the offered position, or the ideal prospective candidate. Two main characteristics we are interested in are *warmth* and *competence*, and the present codebook focuses on whether job descriptions emphasize *warmth-* or *competence*-related characteristics and traits. Explanations and example sentences of warmth- and competence-related terms are provided below, under C2.1 and C2.2 respectively.

As coder, you will receive a text file containing job advertisement texts along with a Job ID associated with each. You will then be asked to fill in the coding form based on the text of each sentence. We advise the text be kept in view while coding sentences.

Make special note of the lists of words attached to the end of this codebook titled "Table 1" and "Table 2". These words can help you identify the terms in a sentence that may convey warmth and/or competence. Although the tables can be helpful, please use your discretion as well in determining the right coding.

## Description of units

Here you can find some guidelines on how to identify each of the units.

**Registration Unit:** The registration unit is every sentence. This means that you will fill out the coding form once for each sentence you view.

- If a bullet-point format is used, and each bullet-point consists of one word, one term, or one sentence, each bullet-point serves as the registration unit. If each bullet-point consists of more than one term (e.g., good communicator, fast learner, skilled programmer) or one sentence, then each term and/or sentence serves as the registration unit.
- Headings and subheadings are also coded in a similar manner as single sentences unless they consist of more than one sentence, in which case, each sentence is taken as a single registration unit.
- If a sentence contains parentheses, code the portion within the brackets depending on whether it can be a stand-alone sentence. If it is a stand-alone sentence, rules for coding a single sentence apply. If that is not the case, code the parenthesized portion as part of the sentence containing it.

**Contextual Unit:** In case you need to clarify the coding of a sentence, consult the sentences immediately before and after it.

## C1. ADMINISTRATIVE VARIABLES

**C1.1 Coder ID**

This variable is for your personal Coder ID.

Please write down the coder ID exactly as is.

**C1.2 Job ID**

This variable is for the Job ID (provided in the text file) that corresponds to the sentence you are coding.

Please write down the job ID exactly as is.

**C1.3 Sentence**

This variable contains the sentence to be coded.

Please paste the sentence from the provided text file.

## C2. SENTENCE-LEVEL VARIABLES

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODING**

- Code headings, sub-headings, and bullet-points.
- Code parenthesized portions of a sentence separately from the sentence containing it only if the portion within the brackets is a stand-alone sentence.
- A sentence can be coded as containing both warmth AND competence.
- A sentence can be coded as containing neither warmth NOR competence.
- Try to think critically about the sentence text, i.e., what is being said about the characteristics of company and position, or candidate traits, and how much emphasis is placed on those characteristics.
- Pay special attention to the context of a sentence and defer to the contextual units if in doubt.
- Table 1 and Table 2 below can be consulted to determine the coding of a sentence but please strongly defer to the contextual units as well as to your own understanding of the sentence.

Below are examples of how to code sentences, bullet-points, and sentences with parentheses:

**Example: Sentences**

"*The candidate must be skilled in programming and able to work in a team".*

The above example is considered a single sentence. You must code once for "The candidate must be skilled in coding and able to work in a team". The coding form is thus filled out one time for this example.

**Example: Bullet-points**

"*The candidate must be:*

- *Skilled in programming*

- *Able to work in a team*

- *A fast-learner"*

In the above example, the introductory phrase and the three individual bullet-points are each considered a single sentence. You must code once for "The candidate must be", once for "skilled in coding", once for "able to work in a team", and once for "fast-learner". The coding form is thus filled out four times for this example.

**Example: Sentence with parentheses**

"*Ensure quality of solution (in line with requirements set)"*

**VS**

"*Manage project resources (Lead the project team)"*

In the first example above, "in line with requirements set" supplements the quality assurance task. It would be difficult to understand what the candidate is required to do without taking the portion before the parentheses into account. You would code this example as one sentence.
 In the second example above, "Lead the project team" is easily understood from a requirements perspective without deferring to the portion before it.
 Something to keep in mind is the capitalization of the portion within brackets. In the second example, capitalization indicates the independence of the bracketed portion from the part preceding it. You would code this sentence twice, as two separate sentences.

**C2.1 Sentence warmth assessment**

This variable indicates whether a sentence is related to warmth.

**Definition of warmth and warmth-related skills:**

*Warmth is characterized by a concern for and understanding of others, supportiveness, helpfulness, sincerity, interpersonal sensitivity, and people-orientation. A good indicator of whether a sentence relates to warmth is if elements in the sentence address interpersonal and community-building factors, e.g., dependability, flexibility, and managing team communication.*

**Remember, a sentence can be coded as both related to warmth AND competence as well as related to neither warmth NOR competence.**

Below are examples of how to code for the presence of warmth in a sentence:

***Special note:*** *When terms like international, global, multicultural, etc. are used, focus on whether it relates to teams and people or actual company presence, development, geographic regions, and conglomeratization. The first case relates to warmth whereas the second relates to competence.*

**Example: Warmth**

"*A successful candidate will have a holistic perspective and will be able to adapt the environment to fit the person".*

The above example sentence focuses on adaptation and fitting in an environment. These are interpersonal skills and are related to warmth traits. The coding should reflect that warmth relating traits are present.

**Example: Warmth**

"*The candidate will develop and manage customers as well as ensure a planned approach to Customer Relationship Management in terms of identifying and strengthening revenue, relationship building and ensuring customer retention and customer visits".*

Although the above example sentence mentions a specific managerial approach, its focus is on skills that are related to customer interactions, e.g., relationship building. This sentence can thus be coded as relating to warmth traits. The coding should reflect that warmth relating traits are present. Note that sentences can also be coded to reflect the presence of competence related traits if applicable.

**The sentence is:**

0 = Not related to warmth

1 = Related to warmth

**C2.2 Sentence competence assessment**

This variable indicates whether a sentence is related to competence.

**Definition of competence and competence-related skills:**

*Competence is characterized by self-assertion, leadership, analytical and strategic thinking, efficiency, competitiveness, independence, and task- and outcome-orientation. A good indicator of whether a sentence relates to competence is if elements in the sentence address technical and productivity-centric factors, e.g., technological skills and managing team outcomes.*

**Remember, a sentence can be coded as both related to warmth AND competence as well as related to neither warmth NOR competence.**

Below are examples of how to code for the presence of competence in a sentence:

* ***Special note:*** *When terms like international, global, multicultural, etc. are used, focus on whether it relates to teams and people or actual company presence, development, geographic regions, and conglomeratization. The first case relates to warmth whereas the second relates to competence.*

**Example: Competence**

"*This role is responsible for leveraging digital channels to drive traffic and sales to both to our broad network of labs and online via our new eCommerce initiatives".*

The above example sentence focuses on technical skills that are related to competence, e.g., expertise in eCommerce. The coding should reflect that competence related traits are present.

**Example: Competence**

"*Candidate must have a degree in teaching the English language and be familiar with bilingual education and various international exam programmes like IB and Cambridge".*

Although the above example sentence addresses language and communication, which is an interpersonal skill, the focus of the tasks is on technical and strategic skills, which are related to competence characteristics. The coding should reflect that competencerelated traits are present.

**The sentence is:**

0 = Not related to competence

1 = Related to competence

**C2.99 Coder Remark**

This variable is for anything noted by the coder regarding the item.

Please leave blank if not applicable.
