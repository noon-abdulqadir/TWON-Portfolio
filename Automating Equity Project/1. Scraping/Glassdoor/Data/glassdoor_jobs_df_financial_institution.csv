But Mambu is different. We are not just cloud-native, lean and flexible - we are helping to revolutionise financial services globally. We are in a growth phase and we’ve only just begun.

To help us on our mission, we bring together people with the best skills and attitude. It doesn’t matter where you are from, what matters is the impact you have and your passion to make a difference.

To continue our success story we are looking for a skilled and enthusiastic Senior Manager, Advisory Services to join our team and help us grow a consulting team from the ground up and create a new service for one of the decade’s most eminent pre-IPO FinTechs. Typically, the Advisory Services team will work with clients – established banks, neobanks, FinTechs and new entrants to financial services – to help shape their vision for a digitally-led future, designing new ventures, new propositions and discovering ways to improve operational efficiency. This role is unique and not like one you would find in a traditional consulting firm. The alignment of Advisory Services with the company’s ‘best of breed’ technology platform (as defined by Gartner), used by more than 200 clients in 55 countries, creates a competitive edge through the ability to design and deliver innovations. In many ways, this is a career defining role which requires an entrepreneurial mindset – where the role holder is personally vested in the outcome. Success will be measured as having evolved the company by creating a powerful and transformative offer to the industry. Personal success will be measured by the step change in your career, on an international stage, and the proof points which attest to your ability to create and scale a new line of business.
