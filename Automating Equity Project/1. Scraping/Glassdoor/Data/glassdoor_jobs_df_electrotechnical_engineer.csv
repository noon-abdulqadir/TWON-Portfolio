Using your electronic background in testing complex charging systems for electric cars, buses and trucks? Where the safety of people comes first? And where, as an embedded test engineer, you test more than just software and hardware? As if this doesn't offer enough challenge, there is also the need to set up your own tests. From writing out test plans to testing scenarios.What are you going to do at ABB?In summary, as an embedded test engineer you provide complex charging systems for electric cars, buses and trucks with the best soft- and hardware. In more detail? You carry out various (simulation) tests so that software runs correctly on electric vehicle charging systems. To ensure safety, all features must be fully correct where you realize that even the smallest software changes affect the functionality of the hardware.You are the tester who does everything possible to ensure that the tooling we offer to our customers and our own employees is as optimal as possible. So do you think it's necessary to make any changes after your test on an electric vehicle charger? Then you send it back to the developer with a solid foundation. Your colleagues know that your 'seal of approval' is only given when the smallest details are correct. Your testing experience will also come into its own with:performing tests as soon as all features are bundled in a software version. You check if the feature is correct, meets the functional requirements and look at the points of interest of previous releases;automating this kind of testing as much as possible;verifying and validating developer changes;Need to develop test automation scripts & Modify existing test casesNeed to collaborate with other team membersNeed to support release testingcommunicating with the service organization and customer about what is being tested;writing test plans and cases;collaborate with fellow testers in different locations.Who are we?ABB is a global company. Leader in electricity transmission and distribution, process and production automation and electrical, electronic and installation products and systems. We are at the forefront of innovation, following trends and thinking along with our customers.
