The focus is specifically on electrically assisted modes that also require some physical activity such as bicycles, cargo bicycles, push (step) scooters, skateboards, etc, both for private ownership and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) shared schemes. They are conceptualized at the intersection of active mobility and electric mobility.
