Do you have an interest in environmental chemistry and risk assessment? Are you looking for a PhD position where stakeholder interaction dynamics and teamwork are keys to success? We have a vacancy for a PhD in ‘Risk-assessment of re-use in cyclic water systems’ in the new AquaConnect program.AquaConnect is a NWO-funded research program with 13 PhD’s and 4 Post Docs supported by about 40 stakeholders that aims to develop innovative solutions for making water supply resilient against future droughts. The Dutch delta faces enormous challenges in fresh water provision for industry, agriculture, nature and drinking water due to increasingly frequent severe droughts. This requires a water transition towards a system that stores surplus instead of discharging it, and that is able to make use of alternative water sources, such as municipal or industrial wastewater, brines, stored surface waters, precipitation, polder waters, cooling water or a mix of various alternative waters. Closing water cycles and using these alternative sources increases the risk of accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in water cycles. To realize safe re-use, information therefore will be required on the risks that CEC and their possible transformation products (TP) pose, i.e. their fate during the re-use, the exposure and risks to human and environmental health and the need to mitigate these risks.What are you going to doYou will contribute to AquaConnect by scientific research into risk-assessment of cyclic water systems that include treatment technologies, nature-based treatment and storage.You will study CEC and their TP, examine their occurrence, fate during re-use, removal during technologies applied and ultimate risks to humans and environment. We aim at a systematic investigation in both laboratory and full-scale case studies. You will focus your research on the following:The fate and risks of CEC during water re-use will be evaluated based on High Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Next Generation Sequencing and Effect Based Monitoring;evaluation of mitigation options, e.g. how use of alternative source or water pre-treatment by advanced and/or nature-based technologies can lower occurrence of CECs;identification of most problematic parent compounds that might hamper current intentions to reach a more circular use of water and evaluate compounds’ common properties;determine how the risk assessments currently underpinning the registration and authorization of chemicals can be adapted to water re-use and circular economy;generalization of lessons learned in practical and science-based guidelines for end-users.You will combine laboratory work, modelling work and field experiments and communicate your results via conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals. You will write a high-quality PhD thesis, while closely working with the program team.Furthermore, we expect you to be an active member of our research group and to take part in teaching efforts, including assisting in practical courses and supervision of bachelor and master students. We aim to start with AquaConnect on September 1st, 2021.What do we requireA successfully completed MSc degree in environmental sciences, chemistry, biology with a focus on environmental chemistry, toxicology and risk assessment;you can show relevant scientific and technical skills, have experience with practical lab work, preferably related to environmental chemistry;good analytical and statistical skills, including the use of programming languages;you have excellent English language and communication skills;you are motivated to pursue a PhD, are independent and have the ability to collaborate and to engage in a training network;you are a team player and can easily link to other scientific disciplines. Working together across disciplines is essential for the success of this program.Our offerA temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be €2,395 gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week).

Would you like to contribute to a successful water transition? Do you have an interest in environmental chemistry and risk assessment? Are you looking for a PhD position where stakeholder interaction dynamics and teamwork are keys to success? We have a vacancy for a PhD in ‘Risk-assessment of re-use in cyclic water systems’ in the new AquaConnect program.AquaConnect is a NWO-funded research program with 13 PhD’s and 4 Post Docs supported by about 40 stakeholders that aims to develop innovative solutions for making water supply resilient against future droughts. The Dutch delta faces enormous challenges in fresh water provision for industry, agriculture, nature and drinking water due to increasingly frequent severe droughts. This requires a water transition towards a system that stores surplus instead of discharging it, and that is able to make use of alternative water sources, such as municipal or industrial wastewater, brines, stored surface waters, precipitation, polder waters, cooling water or a mix of various alternative waters. Closing water cycles and using these alternative sources increases the risk of accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) in water cycles. To realize safe re-use, information therefore will be required on the risks that CEC and their possible transformation products (TP) pose, i.e. their fate during the re-use, the exposure and risks to human and environmental health and the need to mitigate these risks.What are you going to doYou will contribute to AquaConnect by scientific research into risk-assessment of cyclic water systems that include treatment technologies, nature-based treatment and storage.You will study CEC and their TP, examine their occurrence, fate during re-use, removal during technologies applied and ultimate risks to humans and environment. We aim at a systematic investigation in both laboratory and full-scale case studies. You will focus your research on the following:The fate and risks of CEC during water re-use will be evaluated based on High Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Next Generation Sequencing and Effect Based Monitoring;evaluation of mitigation options, e.g. how use of alternative source or water pre-treatment by advanced and/or nature-based technologies can lower occurrence of CECs;identification of most problematic parent compounds that might hamper current intentions to reach a more circular use of water and evaluate compounds’ common properties;determine how the risk assessments currently underpinning the registration and authorization of chemicals can be adapted to water re-use and circular economy;generalization of lessons learned in practical and science-based guidelines for end-users.You will combine laboratory work, modelling work and field experiments and communicate your results via conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals. You will write a high-quality PhD thesis, while closely working with the program team.Furthermore, we expect you to be an active member of our research group and to take part in teaching efforts, including assisting in practical courses and supervision of bachelor and master students. We aim to start with AquaConnect on September 1st, 2021.What do we requireA successfully completed MSc degree in environmental sciences, chemistry, biology with a focus on environmental chemistry, toxicology and risk assessment;you can show relevant scientific and technical skills, have experience with practical lab work, preferably related to environmental chemistry;good analytical and statistical skills, including the use of programming languages;you have excellent English language and communication skills;you are motivated to pursue a PhD, are independent and have the ability to collaborate and to engage in a training network;you are a team player and can easily link to other scientific disciplines. Working together across disciplines is essential for the success of this program.Our offerA temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be €2,395 gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week). This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.Are you curious about our extensive package of secondary employment benefits like our excellent opportunities for study and development? Take a look here.About the Faculty of Science and the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem DynamicsThe Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale.QuestionsDo you have questions about this vacancy?

54,water supply,Glassdoor,4073795307,Senior Mechanical Engineer,Universiteit Utrecht,Utrecht,Hogescholen en universiteiten,Onderwijs,"Are you looking for a PhD position where stakeholder interaction dynamics and teamwork are the keys to success? Do you have an interest in Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Modelling, including the impacts of groundwater salinity on freshwater availability? We have vacancies for two PhDs in the new AquaConnect programme. Will you join our team?AquaConnect is a large NWO-funded research programme with 13 PhD’s and 4 Postdocs supported by about 40 stakeholders that aims to develop innovative solutions for making water supply resilient against future droughts. Collaboration among Researchers and with stakeholders is an important part of the job. We aim to start with AquaConnect on September 1st, 2021. AquaConnect offers you the opportunity to obtain your PhD in advanced hydrogeology, to work with others and to contribute to a sustainable society.About AquaConnectThe Dutch delta faces significant challenges in freshwater provision for industry, agriculture, nature and domestic water during increasingly frequent severe droughts and salinization due to climate change (and the associated sea-level rise). This requires a major overhaul towards a water system that stores precipitation surplus instead of discharging it to the sea and towards use of alternative water sources, such as waste water treatment plant effluents, surface water (e.g. rain) water collected from residential areas and brackish (ground)water. AquaConnect is instrumental in this transition by developing:chemical technologies, enabling the use of domestic/industrial effluents and brackish (ground)water;digital technologies to design smart grid infrastructures to connect supply, demand, and nature based storage;tools to manage related societal changes;and demonstrations in four utilization cases and international twinning.AquaConnect scientific research will be performed in the following work packages:digital technologies to identify new (ground)water resources and assess the impact of its extraction on the environment;risk-assessment of cyclic water systems that include nature-based treatment and storage;chemical and physical technologies for fit-for-purpose water, brine and sludge supply;freshwater provision governance;the digital smart water-grid.The scientific research in all work packages will be performed in close collaboration with a work-package focused on the application of the scientific results in four demonstration areas in the Netherlands. As a PhD candidate in AquaConnect, you will collaborate intensively with other (PhD) Researchers and end-users from various companies and institutes to translate your scientific results into tangible pilot-application and demonstration in these Dutch demonstration areas. More details about the programme can be found here.What will you be doing?You will be part of a wide and dynamic consortium with significant social and environmental impacts. Your work will be beneficial to finding sustainable adaptations to the consequences of climate change.As our PhD1 (Regional-scale integrated modelling and water self-sufficiency) you will focus your research on the following:setup high-resolution and scalable Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Models including salinity groundwater for several (mainly Dutch) case studies;develop scenarios of water demand and water availability under future climate and socio-economic changes;run sensitivity runs to derive fast models of reduced complexity to model the coupled hydrological-water provision system;test the effectiveness of various aquifer storage-recovery and recycling methods in reaching regional water self-sufficiency.As our PhD2 (Managing fresh groundwater resources using data-model integration) you will focus your research on the following:set up a scalable hyper-resolution variable-density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model framework around a drinking water pumping facility of a water company;design and set up a monitoring scheme using in-situ and proximal sensing geophysics methods for 3D monitoring of groundwater salinity;set up a model-data-assimilation framework to integrate model simulations and geophysical observations for optimal prediction of fresh groundwater dynamics and model-predictive control of groundwater extraction;develop a toolbox based on the above that can be used at other water company sites.Profiel Who are you?We are looking for candidates with:an MSc in earth sciences, hydrology, civil engineering, environmental sciences or a related field;motivation to contribute to sustainable fresh water solutions;demonstrable enthusiasm for numerical modelling of groundwater or surface water and mastering a scripting or programming language (e.g., Python, R, Fortran, C++);willingness to work at the interface of academia and application-driven research;the willingness to work in multi-disciplinary teams and interact with stakeholders;English oral and writing skills. You should be able to demonstrate English language proficiency. We require a qualification English at C1 level (comparable to level 3 of the Lecturer Assessment Grid) or you should be willing to obtain this level by training;preferably (at least) basic Dutch oral skills or a willingness to master the Dutch language.AanbodYou will be offered a temporary position (1.0 FTE), initially for one year with an extension to four years in total upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period.

69,water supply,Glassdoor,4060395574,Business Controller- Life Sciences,Royal HaskoningDHV,Amersfoort,Hogescholen en universiteiten,Onderwijs,"Are you looking for a PhD position where stakeholder interaction dynamics and teamwork are the keys to success? Do you have an interest in Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Modelling, including the impacts of groundwater salinity on freshwater availability? We have vacancies for two PhDs in the new AquaConnect programme. Will you join our team?AquaConnect is a large NWO-funded research programme with 13 PhD’s and 4 Postdocs supported by about 40 stakeholders that aims to develop innovative solutions for making water supply resilient against future droughts. Collaboration among Researchers and with stakeholders is an important part of the job. We aim to start with AquaConnect on September 1st, 2021. AquaConnect offers you the opportunity to obtain your PhD in advanced hydrogeology, to work with others and to contribute to a sustainable society.About AquaConnectThe Dutch delta faces significant challenges in freshwater provision for industry, agriculture, nature and domestic water during increasingly frequent severe droughts and salinization due to climate change (and the associated sea-level rise). This requires a major overhaul towards a water system that stores precipitation surplus instead of discharging it to the sea and towards use of alternative water sources, such as waste water treatment plant effluents, surface water (e.g. rain) water collected from residential areas and brackish (ground)water. AquaConnect is instrumental in this transition by developing:chemical technologies, enabling the use of domestic/industrial effluents and brackish (ground)water;digital technologies to design smart grid infrastructures to connect supply, demand, and nature based storage;tools to manage related societal changes;and demonstrations in four utilization cases and international twinning.AquaConnect scientific research will be performed in the following work packages:digital technologies to identify new (ground)water resources and assess the impact of its extraction on the environment;risk-assessment of cyclic water systems that include nature-based treatment and storage;chemical and physical technologies for fit-for-purpose water, brine and sludge supply;freshwater provision governance;the digital smart water-grid.The scientific research in all work packages will be performed in close collaboration with a work-package focused on the application of the scientific results in four demonstration areas in the Netherlands. As a PhD candidate in AquaConnect, you will collaborate intensively with other (PhD) Researchers and end-users from various companies and institutes to translate your scientific results into tangible pilot-application and demonstration in these Dutch demonstration areas. More details about the programme can be found here.What will you be doing?You will be part of a wide and dynamic consortium with significant social and environmental impacts. Your work will be beneficial to finding sustainable adaptations to the consequences of climate change.As our PhD1 (Regional-scale integrated modelling and water self-sufficiency) you will focus your research on the following:setup high-resolution and scalable Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Models including salinity groundwater for several (mainly Dutch) case studies;develop scenarios of water demand and water availability under future climate and socio-economic changes;run sensitivity runs to derive fast models of reduced complexity to model the coupled hydrological-water provision system;test the effectiveness of various aquifer storage-recovery and recycling methods in reaching regional water self-sufficiency.As our PhD2 (Managing fresh groundwater resources using data-model integration) you will focus your research on the following:set up a scalable hyper-resolution variable-density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport model framework around a drinking water pumping facility of a water company;design and set up a monitoring scheme using in-situ and proximal sensing geophysics methods for 3D monitoring of groundwater salinity;set up a model-data-assimilation framework to integrate model simulations and geophysical observations for optimal prediction of fresh groundwater dynamics and model-predictive control of groundwater extraction;develop a toolbox based on the above that can be used at other water company sites.Profiel Who are you?We are looking for candidates with:an MSc in earth sciences, hydrology, civil engineering, environmental sciences or a related field;motivation to contribute to sustainable fresh water solutions;demonstrable enthusiasm for numerical modelling of groundwater or surface water and mastering a scripting or programming language (e.g., Python, R, Fortran, C++);willingness to work at the interface of academia and application-driven research;the willingness to work in multi-disciplinary teams and interact with stakeholders;English oral and writing skills. You should be able to demonstrate English language proficiency. We require a qualification English at C1 level (comparable to level 3 of the Lecturer Assessment Grid) or you should be willing to obtain this level by training;preferably (at least) basic Dutch oral skills or a willingness to master the Dutch language.AanbodYou will be offered a temporary position (1.0 FTE), initially for one year with an extension to four years in total upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period. The gross salary ranges between €2,395 in the first year and €3,061 in the fourth year of employment (scale P according to the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities) per month for a full-time employment. Salaries are supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% per year. In addition, Utrecht University offers excellent secondary conditions, including an attractive retirement scheme, (partly paid) parental leave and flexible employment conditions (multiple choice model).
