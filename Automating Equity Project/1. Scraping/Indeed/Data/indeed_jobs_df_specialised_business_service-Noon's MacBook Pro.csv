Why join the Legal & Public Affairs Team now?

Booking.com’s Legal & Public Affairs team is on a transformational journey (think: growth, innovation, changes to how we operate); you will have an opportunity to actively shape the Department’s future. We are also growing to enable Booking.com’s strategy of the Connected Trip (a travel experience that includes not just accommodation, but also transportation, attractions, experiences, payments, flights etc).

This is a journey that requires close business and Legal & Public Affairs partnerships to navigate complex regulatory environments, build new products, and negotiate increasingly elaborate commercial deals, among other important projects our teams get involved every day. To tackle this mission, it all starts with a strong team passionate about growing Booking.com in an ethical and sustainable way!

Who we are

To match our global footprint and the array of challenges we face, we are proud to highlight the diversity that exists across this group. We are a team of approximately 70 professionals - representing more than 20 nationalities - with lawyers qualified in many different countries, as well as non-lawyers with public policy, economics, compliance and risk backgrounds. Our team’s previous experience spans across a multitude of industries with team members having worked for major global companies (including Uber, Amex, Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Nokia), tech and other startups, government entities (e.g., the Dutch Competition Authority), and reputable international law firms (e.g., Hogan Lovells, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Baker Mckenzie), and Public Affairs firms (e.g., FTI Consulting, FIPRA, Brunswick).

In addition to our day-to-day work, we actively seek opportunities for our team members to engage in the wider global legal and public affairs communities through speaking engagements, training programs, and association memberships. Some of our lawyers are Board members of Consumer Law associations, Competition Law associations, Privacy associations, etc. We also truly believe in engaging with stakeholders to share our insights on policies affecting the travel experience and how travel tech innovations can fuel the digital transformation of the travel industry. For example, we recently launched Booking.com’s Public Affairs blog, where we publish our position on key policy issues (A World Worth Experiencing).

As a team, we believe in:

Integrating with the Business and having a “seat at the table”: we are decision makers that can have a real impact on Booking.com’s future
Booking’s mission of making it easier for everyone to experience the world. Travel helps people become more open minded, curious and flexible
Allowing members of our teams to experience different areas or, if they want to be specialists, give them the tools to become more effective in their jobs
Providing holistic legal and public affairs advice; our team should not work in silos
Always looking for better ways of doing things, improving our Legal Operations function, innovating and exchanging best practices
Accepting that it's OK to make mistakes as long as we learn from them
Having a sense of humour and having fun working together; we are a team that likes to collaborate and share in joys and challenges together!",-1.0,-1,https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=2d7b59d35856ba71&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=83db36a47ea379a0&assa=7749,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=2d7b59d35856ba71&fccid=62ee2fabbf8c93c5&vjs=3,22 dagen geleden,22 dagen geleden,2021-03-10
