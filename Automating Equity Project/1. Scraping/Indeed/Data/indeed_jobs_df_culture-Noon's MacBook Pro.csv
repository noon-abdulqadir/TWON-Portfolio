Teamleader is a SaaS scale-up founded in 2012 in Ghent, Belgium. We offer all-in-one cloud software for CRM, project management and invoicing. Our goal? Helping European SMEs simplify work. We’re growing at rocket speed, and are enjoying every bit of this rollercoaster ride.
Over the years, we’ve won numerous awards that prove our dedication towards our cause. We’ve gained a foothold in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Yet our ambition stretches far and beyond, as we want to become Europe’s #1 in our industry. Today, our team consists of 180+ people and is still growing strong.

To keep fueling our growth, we are looking for a Customer Expert.


What an average work week looks like:

If you join our Customer Expert team, it’s because you strive to be a product expert on the one hand and derive your energy from delighting customers on the other.

Developing product expertise is key in this role. You’ll need to be curious and crazy about details to become a true Teamleader expert. That expertise comes in handy when helping out our customers at the front line virtually. By talking to customers on a daily basis, you get a deep understanding of both our product and our customers. You’ll represent the voice of the customer by actively passing on their feedback and requests to the product & development department. It’s a team effort: our customer experts pick each other’s brain constantly to assure accurate, timely and surprising support that our customers ask for and deserve.
You will use that growing product knowledge not only to support our customers. According to your own growth, interest and talent, you’ll have the chance to participate in support-related projects in the Customer Expert Team, i.e. contributing to our knowledge base, recording webinars, cross departmental activities with our finance, sales or success teams... and much more.
Working at the Customer Expert team, means you will never, ever come home and say you had “just another day at the office”. You will talk with tons of entrepreneurs everyday, you’ll see them grow and help them become more successful. In turn, you’ll gain new product insights daily, which makes you the Teamleader Expert for our customers and your colleagues.
Why others chose Teamleader: we're lively, not corporate

You are part of a fast-growing company that values getting things done and honest communication. The result: a fast-paced tech environment, open feedback culture, room for initiatives and ideas.
We have the energy and boldness of a start-up and the expertise and pragmatism of a scale-up. The result: a team of both young and seasoned professionals led by supportive and approachable managers who give recognition and rewards for hard work. We also value transparency about results and strategy.
You have your own personal budget to spend on training or (virtual) events and numerous other internal advantages. The result: continuous growth and learning.
You have a pleasant and comfortable workplace within cycling and walking distance of the heart of Amsterdam or Ghent. But we are flexible: working remotely is absolutely no problem. And mandatory since the world got hit by COVID-19.


Even in COVID times, Teamleader is a happy, purposeful place. While we miss our shared kitchen and sunlit terrace, our setup allowed for a swift change to a functional and engaging remote work environment. We compensate for social distance with quizzes, cocktails delivered at home, informal chats and events, work-time flexibility, competitions, extra coaching and everything else you can think of.
Requirements
Sounds like something for you? You would be a good fit for this job if you:

Are driven by helping customers get the most out of Teamleader. In fact, customer satisfaction means the world to you.

Are patient, emphatic and you are able to keep your calm, even when things get busy.

Have awesome problem-solving skills and a razor-sharp, analytical mind.

Have the ability to quickly build up excellent product knowledge and do what it takes to keep this up-to-date.

Have full proficiency in Dutch, English and Italian.

Are well-organized and detail-oriented: you love a clean desk and keep your calendar and work neatly organized.

Go the extra mile to provide superior customer support.

Are able to communicate effectively and authentically with customers. You are good at explaining complex problems in an understandable way.

Have affinity with IT. A background in tech is not required, but it is definitely a plus if you’ve been in a SaaS environment before.

With a promising unique technology based on optical fiber sensing, a first product was built in 2012: an extremely sensitive measurement device that could break new ground in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. After this product, many more unique sensing products were developed and put in the market. The company now has two business units serving different markets with different products: Optics11 Life and Optics11 Industrial Sensing. Over the last years the company has grown rapidly and employs over 50 professionals, with an installed base of successful products all over the world.Market Opportunity:Optics11 Life is addressing a large market opportunity. Medical treatment is going through a multi-faceted revolution. Drug development is seeing a paradigm shift towards 3D cell culture and Organ-On-a-Chip (OOC), thereby drastically reducing development cost, failure rates and time to market of vital treatments. Regenerative medicine, which aims to replace damaged tissue in patients based with stem cell based engineered tissue, will provide a cure for previously untreatable conditions, and contribute to a solution for shortage of organs for transplantation.These fields are now developing at a high pace, starting in academia and in R&D and moving towards near-future industrial value chains. This will revolutionize medical treatment in many ways. These changes require new instrumentation, both to drive progress, to validate the achievements and to monitor and control the future industrial processesOne of the driving forces behind both the revolution in regenerative medicine as well as Organ-On-a-Chip, is a deepened understanding of the role of mechanics and forces in physiology and disease. From stem cells to organoids, from hydrogels to engineered tissues, it is becoming increasingly clear that the mechano-biological state is of major importance to the biological processes. Being able to characterize, monitor and control the mechano-biological state is going to be a key element in the emerging chains.Optics11 Life is at the leading edge of these emerging industries, and is extremely well equipped to be able to provide the key instrumentation that these new industrial chains will need.The key responsibilities of a Sales Manager: Lead and grow the International Life Science sales team – a team of young, enthusiastic and talented peopleOrganize the EU and US sales team around (new) products, territories, applicationsContribute to direct salesManage, improve and recruit international distributors in Asia, ROWManage and improve the sales structure and pipelineCreate and execute a sales strategy for new products in pharmaceutical R&DProvide input to the marketing strategyPlan participation in conferences and trade showsContribute to the Optics11 Life management team and company strategySkills and competences: Self-starter, highly motivated personBSc or MSc commercial or engineering/scientific background3-5 years’ experience in sales of technical hardware productsPreferably experience in selling life science instrumentationA combination of technical and commercial qualities.An ambition to lead an international teamAn entrepreneurial driveResilience and the ability to cope with rejectionA professional and outgoing personality, with the ability to work both in a team environment and directly with clientsIs willing to travel the world (35 – 50%)The offer: An opportunity to make a significant impact on the growth of the international Optics11 Life sales organizationCompetitive renumeration depending on experience and performanceFull-time positionBeing part of a young, dynamic and enthusiastic teamFlat hierarchy, short decision lines, big impactWork in a challenging international environmentFreedom and responsibility in structuring and leading your workJoin us!For more information please visit www.optics11life.comFor more information about our products: https://youtu.be/Rej4N7Z4BZITo apply, please look at our website or apply via IndeedContractduur 12 maandenJob Type: ContractExperience:sales: 3 years (Required)Education:Bachelor's (Required)Work Remotely:Temporarily due to COVID-19",-1.0,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken/company/Optics11-BV/jobs/Sales-Manager-32d36b8d13acb99a?fccid=12bfa1ce5da1e629&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-02-26

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges, and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 12 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants, and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

And we’re just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it’s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT’s’ list of Europe’s fastest-growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte’s ‘UK Top 50’ two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

The Business Strategy Manager will be part of the Deliveroo NL Management team and will report directly to our General Manager

LIFE AT DELIVEROO

We are a growing team, with a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritize their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away, and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level, or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to anyone of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion, or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing start-ups around.",-1.0,-1,https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=9b379f7ee0d14e62&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=f104029b3fe3a4af&assa=2283,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=9b379f7ee0d14e62&fccid=1d79a4290fb70d8e&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-02-26

The Legal & Public Affairs team is also a critical part of the enablement of Booking.com’s strategy of the Connected Trip (a travel experience that includes not just accommodation, but also transportation, attractions, experiences, payments, flights etc).

This is a journey that requires close business and Legal & Public Affairs partnerships to redefine our business model, navigate complex regulatory environments, build new products, and negotiate increasingly elaborate commercial deals, among other important projects our teams get involved every day. To tackle this mission, it all starts with a strong team passionate about growing Booking.com in an ethical and sustainable way!

Who we are

To match our global footprint and the array of challenges we face, we are proud to highlight the diversity that exists across this group. We are a team of approximately 70 professionals - representing more than 20 nationalities - with lawyers qualified in many different countries, as well as non-lawyers with public policy, economics, compliance and risk backgrounds. Our team’s previous experience spans across a multitude of industries with team members having worked for major global companies (including Uber, American Express, Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Nokia), tech and other startups, government entities (e.g., the Dutch Competition Authority), and reputable international law firms (e.g., Hogan Lovells, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Baker Mckenzie), and Public Affairs firms (e.g., FTI Consulting, FIPRA, Brunswick).

In addition to our day-to-day work, we actively seek opportunities for our team members to engage in the wider global legal and public affairs communities through speaking engagements, training programs, and association memberships. Some of our lawyers are Board members of Consumer Law associations, Competition Law associations, Privacy associations, etc. We also believe in actively engaging with stakeholders to share our insights on policies affecting the travel experience and how travel tech innovations can fuel the digital transformation of the travel industry. For example, we recently launched Booking.com’s Public Affairs blog, where we publish our position on key policy issues (A World Worth Experiencing).

As a team, we believe in:

Integrating with the Business and Legal having a “seat at the table”: we are decision makers that can have a real impact on Booking.com’s future
Booking’s mission of making it easier for everyone to experience the world. Travel helps people become more open minded, curious and flexible
Allowing members of our teams to experience different areas or, if they want to be specialists, give them the tools to become more effective in their jobs

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
