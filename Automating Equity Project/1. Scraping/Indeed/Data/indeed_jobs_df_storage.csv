Both terms are used widely â and often without knowing or mentioning the difference. Hereâs how we define it at Xccelerated, in line with the vision and possibilities at our partner organizations.
Your role
We offer two different programs to become a cloud professional and future-proof your career: Azure Cloud Development and AWS Cloud Engineering. We believe having a clear focus results in being the best at what you do, or at least accelerating growth of your career as a young professional within Data & AI. Despite the differences mentioned above, there’s of course an overlap in topics/skills which are important for both a cloud engineer and a cloud developer. Therefore, both programs do align, and you’ll work together with colleagues from the other Cloud group and Data Engineering or MLE-MLOps.
Each program begins with a month-long bootcamp training to prepare you for the first day at your future-employer. From that moment, you’ll work four days a week at the location of one of our partner organizations and one day a week at the Xccelerated office — which involves ongoing training and project support from our technical leads. At the end of each program, you'll have what it takes to directly join the company. A winning long-term solution for everyone.
Cloud Engineering & Cloud Development:
DevOps mindset
Infrastructure as Code
Container fundamentals
Kubernetes fundamentals
Traffic management
Application monitoring
System design
And with Cloud Development:
Modern Software Engineering with C# and .NET Core
Azure fundamentals
Security basics (e.g. app security, network patterns, resource access)
Storage Management
Data access patterns (e.g. NoSQL, SQL, Cap)
Building Distributed Systems
Modernizing legacy apps and enabling a transition to the cloud
Your profile
Cloud Developers are, first and foremost, involved in product development. They write client-facing software by making use of cloud-native development techniques. This can include back-end development, front-end work, but also data and application integration, and application deployment.
What makes them different from most software developers, is that they know how to make the most out of cloud service offerings. They understand what it takes to develop their application to run on serverless technologies, or using container orchestration tooling, as well as how to architect for using other cloud-native services. They live by ""you build it, you run it, you own it"" and are not afraid to deploy, monitor, scale and operate the software they've written.
Who are you?
Are you a software developer or -engineer with at least one year of relevant work experience on the .NET Framework? Then you’ve
already got a fantastic foundation for developing further, if you;
Have a technical bachelor’s or master’s degree (e.g. computer science, informatics, software engineering)
Want to develop serverless applications and coded infrastructure and optimized solutions
Like to optimize your solutions for maximum availability & performance
Have the ambition to futureproof your career, working in the most advanced cloud environments
Are willing to learn and have interest in working at one of our data-driven partner companies (e.g. Heineken, ING, Randstad Group, FedEx, Vattenfall)
What we offer
Start date Azure Cloud Development program: February 1st, 2021
The Xccelerated Cloud Engineering program kicks off with a full-time bootcamp. This intensive training focuses on designing, development and maintenance of secure and scalable cloud-native applications, version control, continuous integration, infrastructure-as-code. We will gain hands-on experience with serverless and container-hosted applications. Participants learn through classroom lectures, short assignments, hackathons, and collaborative project assignments with colleagues from our Data Engineering program.
The next 12-months
After the bootcamp, you spend a full year working on-site four days a week at one of our partner companies and returning one day a week to our Xccelerated office in Amsterdam. During these “return” days, you split your time between theory and practice—gaining project guidance and coaching from our supervising consultants to support you in the partner company’s projects, while also diving deeper into training topics not covered in the bootcamp. It’s always about continuous learning. Besides the technical aspect, we’ll focus on your personal development as well.",-1,-1,https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=957258ecd4f417ee&from=vj&sjdu=Hfh73JbOarXW09a54jKVutqXuFSPaH34M2hbMHfupFSU-94tJKPbgX7sVQh75TWjlxN4hjIvlsxeKW7aFTDlFKEQFWzhSULTUfT5W82_ZtPuU7CRInG7oOTsGUecD9nTB7vAwHu2WK8Xptk0aVGVX1QQkfxvk6ltk-XR6jEeZaU&spon=1&adid=306183835&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&ad=-6NYlbfkN0CPV2DcenltS1pkBl_pMyim6Xwkw0vnsRQ4HE8gG1BfL7bPngMDWJwA-SdqDbp8NEWtw7SVU73YpU4pYlzyUI3-iKlK2-vW77DW1pIN0tkbRNBssQ9ky-9Ed13mB3me7BOI3hbTg88binxrx7Zkk9bViT1QENzye8YkSw_QbwKv3cHpgfobAtV-RfsEEE38i-Izajrk4Act1zR98BsrjZkW7YgLq3Bj1z5eqT73qaw-eguduwlKOmtUfQ6nSo6Zqgh-fahg4q935tCP7Oec0P8kKSkqDCqifvuRuw0Kt2llzCY7vef9BPx8wMDAy1LAvDyV4yBdhYpRui90--E0Q8-Xh9ffh5BfcHxXzIDjwm_MdUIE09_CH512ld_pFqno8yy4HIl10bchCPQJrTHgklK89VGtHc-tbhZBPo-KDTt-yo44gasXK9C-yz3bdCDtpsO21Ix6YwLLHl09dVlfIfsCadtEx0jK_knhk-nuwfscmRKjz5sMBz9MGNQ_uGdc171W8FuErpkpza6hoRq5JuAwIJT1kGQp0MMaE1UVKSExJhtwOLFuiACZvADZd64wAVUBTxFMXHm6kPN4Vc_yIdfBAURdb5U9FncwyKCZq5GHctxBKykFeH71I1NpSeVeIvzCNUh1cDoMfnfQEj1Ic_95oEzJzsC9fLk=&astse=4db36039079ca154&assa=9593,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken/pagead/clk?mo=r&ad=-6NYlbfkN0CPV2DcenltS1pkBl_pMyim6Xwkw0vnsRQ4HE8gG1BfL7bPngMDWJwA-SdqDbp8NEWtw7SVU73YpU4pYlzyUI3-iKlK2-vW77DW1pIN0tkbRNBssQ9ky-9Ed13mB3me7BOI3hbTg88binxrx7Zkk9bViT1QENzye8YkSw_QbwKv3cHpgfobAtV-RfsEEE38i-Izajrk4Act1zR98BsrjZkW7YgLq3Bj1z5eqT73qaw-eguduwlKOmtUfQ6nSo6Zqgh-fahg4q935tCP7Oec0P8kKSkqDCqifvuRuw0Kt2llzCY7vef9BPx8wMDAy1LAvDyV4yBdhYpRui90--E0Q8-Xh9ffh5BfcHxXzIDjwm_MdUIE09_CH512ld_pFqno8yy4HIl10bchCPQJrTHgklK89VGtHc-tbhZBPo-KDTt-yo44gasXK9C-yz3bdCDtpsO21Ix6YwLLHl09dVlfIfsCadtEx0jK_knhk-nuwfscmRKjz5sMBz9MGNQ_uGdc171W8FuErpkpza6hoRq5JuAwIJT1kGQp0MMaE1UVKSExJhtwOLFuiACZvADZd64wAVUBTxFMXHm6kPN4Vc_yIdfBAURdb5U9FncwyKCZq5GHctxBKykFeH71I1NpSeVeIvzCNUh1cDoMfnfQEj1Ic_95oEzJzsC9fLk=&p=0&fvj=0&vjs=3,15 dagen geleden,15 dagen geleden,2021-01-23

We do this by building and running the world’s best data and AI infrastructure platform, so our customers can focus on the high value challenges that are central to their own missions.

Founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark, Databricks has grown from a tiny corner office in Berkeley, California to a global organization with over 1000 employees. Thousands of organizations, from small to Fortune 100, trust Databricks with their mission-critical workloads, making us one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in the world.

Our engineering teams build highly technical products that fulfill real, important needs in the world.

At our scale, we regularly observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.

To achieve this goal, we believe the data warehouse architecture as we know it today will be replaced by a new architectural pattern, Lakehouse (CIDR 2021 paper), open platforms that unify data warehousing and advanced analytics. The new architecture will help address several major challenges, including data staleness, reliability, total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support.

A critical part of realizing this vision is the next generation (decoupled) query engine and structured storage system that can outperform specialized data warehouses in relational query performance, yet retain the expressiveness and resilience of general purpose systems such as Spark to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science.

As part of this team, you will be working in one or more of the following areas to design and implement these next gen systems that leapfrog state-of-the-art:

Query compilation and optimization
Distributed query execution and scheduling
Vectorized execution engine
Data security
Resource management
Transaction coordination
Efficient storage structures (encodings, indexes)
Automatic physical data optimization

You may be a fit if you:

Have a passion for database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, language design, or performance optimization
Are comfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables
Driven by delivering customer value and impact
Preferred: Have 3+ years of experience working in a related system
Optional: PhD in databases or distributed systems

Sluitingsdatum 15 februari 2021

Opleidingsniveau Master's degree

Functieomvang 38 hours per week

Salarisindicatie €2,395 to €3,061 gross per month

Vacaturenummer 20-801

The Parallel Computing Systems (PCS) group at the Informatics Institute (IvI) of the University of Amsterdam is looking for a PhD candidate in the area of approximate computing techniques for energy-efficient and fault-tolerant embedded systems. The PCS group performs research on the design, programming and run-time management of multi-core and multi-processor computer systems. The modeling, analysis and optimization of the extra-functional aspects of these systems, such as performance, power/energy consumption but also the degree of productivity to design and program these systems, play a pivotal role in our work.
The PhD position is part of a large EU-funded (Marie Skłodowska Curie) International Training Network (ITN) action, called ‘Approximate Computing for Power and Energy Optimisation (APROPOS)’, funding 15 PhD positions at 14 top-level universities and companies in Europe. In this ITN action, you can complement your research experience with a 3-6 month cross-sector secondment by working with one of the highly committed industrial partners of the ITN action, which is in our case Thales Netherlands.
What are you going to do?
Following the current trend, by 2040 computers will need more electricity than the world energy resources can generate. On the communications side, energy consumption in mobile broadband networks is comparable to datacentres. To make things worse, Internet-of-Things will soon connect 20 to 50 billion devices through wireless networks to the cloud. APROPOS aims at decreasing energy consumption in both distributed computing and communications for cloud-based cyber-physical systems. We propose adaptive Approximate Computing to optimize energy-accuracy trade-offs. Luckily, in many parts of the global data acquisition, transfer, computation, and storage systems there exists the possibility to trade off accuracy to either less power or less time consumed – or both.
Are you interested to help us studying the symbiotic combination of two seemingly incompatible concepts in the context of APROPOS: fault tolerance and approximate computing? This would entail:
investigating how approximate computing techniques can be deployed at the system level to improve fault tolerance of embedded systems, while trying to meet their performance and power/energy consumption constraints. In particular, study and evaluate techniques for achieving fault tolerance by means of
runtime mapping strategies that exploit a variety in precision of cores (i.e. approximating cores), and
task replication and fuzzy voting strategies utilizing lower-precision replicas;
designing and developing a software framework for system-level simulation and design space exploration (DSE) to study and evaluate the developed techniques.
What do we require?
We are looking for you if you are a motivated university graduate who is open to industrial cooperation and is a top performer among his/her peers, has an excellent education and/or research track record proven by relevant experience, publications, etc. You are expected to conduct original competitive research, publishing the results in relevant conferences and/or journals.
Applicants are further expected to have:
an M.Sc. degree in computer science or computer engineering;
some prior expertise in one or more of the following fields: computer systems architecture, modelling and simulation, and/or performance analysis;
excellent skills in oral and written English with good presentation skills;
strong analytical and problem-solving skills;
excellent programming and debugging skills, preferably in C/C++;
the ability to work in an international research team.
Our offer
A temporary contract for 38 hours per week, preferably starting mid 2021, for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.
The salary will be €2,395 to €3,061 (scale P) gross per month, based on a full-time contract of 38 hours a week. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.
