water,Indeed,p_205dcee22d656691,Internship | Novel nanostructured catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers,TNO, Petten,"What will you be doing?
Climate change and pollution resulting from predominantly fossil fuels usage require our society to pursue clean and renewable energy sources. Hydrogen ranks as the most promising energy carrier with specific energy density of approximately 3 times that of gasoline and no adverse environmental footprint when produced using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Splitting water to produce hydrogen in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (PEMWE’s) has been recognized as an ideal solution to the intermittent nature of the renewable energy sources. Excess renewable energy is stored in the form of molecular bonds (Hydrogen) that can be used to run fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV’s) and/or electrify the chemical industry (Syngas production, chemicals/fuels synthesis, etc.). However, for the widespread adaptation of PEMWE’s the cost of the components and their durability/lifetime should improve significantly. This internship provides an exciting opportunity to address the challenges associated with PEMWE’s components, in particular with respect to electrocatalyst performance and durability. You will be using in-situ/ex-situ (electro)chemical/electroanalytical methods and synthesis to investigate novel oxygen evolution (OER) catalysts for use in PEMWE’s.
What do we require of you?
You are an enthusiastic master student looking for an internship of 6-9 months (only students will be considered). You have a chemical engineering, chemistry or material science/engineering background and you are eager to learn about electrochemistry and electrochemical methods. You are pro-active and independent with good communication skills in English. You will be working with a diverse team of scientists/engineering/technicians with a wide variety of expertise to make up for a great learning experience.

Among others, your main tasks will be:
Conduct literature search to benchmark the know-how present as state-of-art;
Catalyst synthesis and characterization, electrode fabrication, PEMWE cell preparation and testing;
Participate in group meetings, provide feed-back, discuss results, and propose solutions.
What can you expect of your work situation?
You will be living in Noord-Holland area with breath-takingly beautiful sceneries and living environment. The area, well-known for its sandy beaches in Petten and Bergen, provides a quiet and most beautiful environment for outdoor activities (boating/sailing, swimming, biking, etc.) with easy access to the nearby larger cities such as Amsterdam and Alkmaar.

Als een instrument defect is, wordt de oorzaak van het probleem opgespoord op basis van eigen kennis en troubleshooting skills, en/of door middel van geavanceerde diagnosesoftware. Na het vervangen van onderdelen wordt het instrument gekalibreerd, gereinigd en wederom grondig getest zodat het weer aan de hoogste kwaliteitseisen voldoet.

Ook zonder ervaring met analyzers kun je bij ons terecht, wij bieden interne technische en functionele trainingen zodat jij je werk zelfstandig kunt uitvoeren. Na de ruime inwerkperiode heb je kennis van de IDEXX-specifieke producten die je onderhoudt en repareert volgens het productieplan, beschikbare engineering documentatie en werkinstructies.

Water and sanitation (WatSan) play an important role in our projects, as water is the source of life, but can also spread diseases and cause death.

Your job
Water and sanitation (WatSan) play an important role in our projects, as water is the source of life, but can also spread diseases and cause death.

Your objective will be to prevent and control diseases transmitted by contaminated water or by poor sanitation or hygiene, both within and beyond the health facilities we run or support. As a WatSan specialist, you will not necessarily be focused solely on the health facilities, but may also be responsible for the water and sanitation provisions of an entire refugee camp. Your job will involve maintaining a reliable water supply, constructing or upgrading sanitary facilities and supporting the promotion of hygiene, as well as organising appropriate (medical) waste disposal. You will work closely with the project team (medical and non-medical staff). Your work will include training and supervising locally hired staff.
