, This opportunity is designed to give you the contacts and experience to help further your career You are not replacing any member of staff, but helping alongside them, whilst learning new skills, ,  Placements are available throughout the summer months, between June and October, , , , The dolphin has had a close relationship with the human race for many millennia It has been depicted in art and literature since before the time of the ancient Greeks and was considered an omen of good luck It was sometimes even linked with the gods, to the extent that killing a dolphin equated killing another human and was punishable by death Their intelligence and friendly appearance has continued to inspire fascination for this enigmatic creature throughout the ages This close relationship has nonetheless never been an easy one and dolphins have been hunted for both their meat and skin throughout time Today they are competing with humans for the remaining fish stock of our seas and are increasingly forced out of their habitats Fishing equipment and boats are also a common cause of injury and death for dolphins worldwide, , There are four species of dolphins present in the Greek Seas, all of whom are considered threatened, yet no systematic research effort has been carried out so far to study their populations and ecology, , The Dolphin Research project programme aims to learn more about the dolphin populations in one of Europes largest marine protected areas, through recording populations and group sizes, identifying individuals, and recording behaviours and habits As a volunteer you will help out on daily field surveys at sea where you will get to know the local dolphin population and help collect data Back on land you will help with entering this data into databases, learning how to convert the collected data into effective conservation measures You will also have the opportunity to attend lectures and seminars on marine mammals and local ecology, which will provide valuable insights into marine mammal life, monitoring techniques and other topics related to the local marine environment, , The important knowledge gathered during this research initiative will be used in the conservation of marine mammals in Greece and in the preparation of effective research and management actions for the local Cetacean population, , As the first study of its kind in the area, the project aims to estimate the relative abundance of the common dolphin Delphinus delphis and the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus and identify important areas for them One of the main components of the project will be to identify individuals and compile a photoidentification catalogue of the two species The data collected will be used to analyse dolphin abundance, movements, reproductive success, habitat use, and social organization, , Daily Life, , You will learn how to photograph individuals and groups of dolphins as well as record group size, composition newborns, calves, juveniles, adults, and behavior If other marine mammals are sighted, such as the critically endangered Mediterranean Monk seal, these will also be recorded along with any fisheries interactions, , You will be working alongside the resident researchers on board the organisation research vessel, a 13metre long traditional wooden caique As the heart of the organisations activities over the past 23 years, this boat has sailed many thousands of miles across the Greek seas The work at sea as well as preparations such as the loading and unloading of equipment will be undertaken in the mornings In the afternoon you will return back to port for recreation and rest In the afternoon and evenings you will be taught how to file, name, crop, and prepare digital photos of dolphin dorsal fins for subsequent matching as well as attend seminars and lectures from staff and visiting field specialists, , Among the skills and knowledge you will be taught are, , The project HQ is
