9,doctor,Indeed,p_9019998ec9ceeaf1,Postdoc: Biophysics of symbiotic networks and communities,AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Symbiotic partnerships can drive the evolution of remarkably complex social behaviors, even in simple organisms. Recent experiments provide evidence that symbiotic microbes demonstrate transport and trade behaviors reminiscent of human economics. What is the repertoire of strategies at play in these biological ‘markets’ and how do they depend on the specific combination of species and strains involved? To what extent is the strategy of one partner responsive to that of others, and how are the necessary communications/computations implemented mechanistically?

In this project, you will address these questions experimentally, developing novel methods for tracking symbiotic trade across time and space, combining the state of the art in fluorescent labelling, automated microscopy and image analysis. A focal symbiotic partnership is between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant roots, which form an extended symbiotic network of ecological/agricultural importance in the soil. You will build on our existing automated imaging experiment of this symbiosis using in vitro root cultures, introducing new fungal and bacterial species in the mix. Results will be analyzed using concepts from statistical physics and network theory. A central aim is to illuminate trade strategies and their underlying mechanisms with biophysical data on network growth, resource fluxes and their control by symbiotic context.

The project builds on our prior work to characterize resource fluxes using quantum-dot labelled nutrients to track symbiotic trade (Whiteside et al., 2019, Curr Biol), and will be embedded within a new HFSP-funded consortium to pioneer the biophysics of fungi in symbiotic contexts. The team includes biologists, physicists and engineers from the labs of
Toby Kiers (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)Howard Stone (Princeton University)Hirokazu Toju (Kyoto University)Tom Shimizu (AMOLF)

You will collaborate closely with members of all participating labs through regular consortium-wide Zoom meetings, also with possibilities (when the pandemic subsides) for in-person research exchanges through lab visits.

For further information on the project, contact Tom Shimizu (shimizu@amolf.nl).

10,doctor,Indeed,p_e2738b7a264d156c,Postdoc: Measuring predictive information in living cells.,AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Remarkable recent experiments have demonstrated that single-celled organisms are able to respond not only to experienced changes in the past, but also to expected changes that have yet to occur – evidently exploiting temporal correlations in the environment to predict the future. But how reliably can a cell make such predictions, which are the mechanisms that implement them, and what are their fitness benefits?

In this project, you will address these questions experimentally, using single-cell microscopy to precisely quantify (in bits) the amount of predictive information cells extract from past experiences. The primary experimental vehicle will be a single-cell FRET method developed in our group (Keegstra et al., 2017 eLife; Kamino et al., 2020, Science Advances). Your measurements will quantify information transmission and prediction in the E. coli chemotaxis system – a cell signaling network for which sufficient quantitative knowledge exists to address further questions about mechanistic origins and functional benefits of prediction. You will collaborate closely with the theory group of Pieter Rein ten Wolde (AMOLF), using concepts from information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to design and interpret experiments.
