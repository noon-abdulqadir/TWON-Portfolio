need for poaching and hunting turtles away and to achieve a sea turtle management, , The main threats to sea turtles on this public beach are caused by humans nesting turtles are contributing to a population decline of all species Especially in the Caribbean, the consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs or the utilization of turtle shell for jewelry production is rooted in longlived local traditions and a strong belief that sea turtle eggs serve as an aphrodisiac On top of these dangers, sea turtles also face the and contamination, which results in nest and habitat loss due to beach erosion or entanglement in fishing gear and trash Through the involvement of local inhabitants of this very isolated, small community, the Pacuare sea turtle project provides not only a unique opportunity for volunteers to experience a Costa Rican conservation project but also offers a legal and sustainable revenue for community members The data taken from nesting females improves our understanding of their behaviour and helps coordinating conservation efforts worldwide, , Daily Life, , , , It is important to remember that sea turtles always come first This may mean working long, hard hours under hot and humid conditions but in the end, it is worth it, , A group of volunteers, led by an experienced patrol leader, walks one of the sectors of the 71km long beach searching for nesting females An average night patrol will take 4 hours but can last longer in case of sea turtle encounters Once a turtle is encountered on a night patrol, the volunteers work directly with it, taking carapace and nest dimension measurements, collecting eggs and collecting data The collected eggs will be relocated on the beach or taken to the hatchery where the volunteers on shift will build a new nest and rebury the eggs The number of eggs, nest location and turtle identification information tag number are then recorded by the hatchery attendant for further data analysis, for example determining hatchling survival rate, , This project applies a nonconfrontation policy with poachers while patrolling the beach Encounters with poachers are likely during turtle season but no communication or interference has proven to be the best way of dealing with illegal activities, as we are a conservation organization and not the police, , , , The main tasks in the hatchery will be relocating nests as described above and after having had thorough training, monitoring nests, keeping predators out ants, crabs, dogs, taking temperatures and measurements and releasing hatchlings The approximate incubation time for all sea turtle eggs is 60 days, therefore midway through the season the duties of the hatchery volunteer increase as the hatchlings begin to emerge At this time, all nests in the hatcheries must be checked every 20 minutes during day and night If hatchlings are encountered, they must be counted and released in the evening to an appropriate location along the high tide line and observed until they reach the sea All work must be done according to standard protocols and rules and only after receiving training, , , , Day time work will be for more or less two hours in the mornings, and can include beach cleanups, or involvement in small projects, maintenance of the equipment, including initial construction of the hatcheries amongst others, , all

human and was punishable by death Their intelligence and friendly appearance has continued to inspire fascination for this enigmatic creature throughout the ages This close relationship has
