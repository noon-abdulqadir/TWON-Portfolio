mining,Indeed,p_b5e14af6b0abd10d,Data Science Internship Emotion & Sentiment mining,ZyLAB, Amsterdam,"Currently, we are actively looking for graduate students and interns, who are looking for paid and interesting research projects. The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.

The next internship/graduation project is available:

Problem

In criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb’s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years’ experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.

Key challenges

The key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.

The system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).

Research Questions

What are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.
What are the best features to use for the machine learning.
How good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).
What relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?
What post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?

Other Expected / Desired Outcomes

At ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.

Data Sets

ZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/

Compensation

Depending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you. We hear from our students that it is often 2—3 times higher than with other organizations.

In addition, we will reimburse your travel cost and you can participate in all activities we organize for our employees.

Requirements

Mandatory internship form your University
BSc and MSc students on Dutch or Belgian Universities
Fields related to data science such as Artificial Intelligence, computer science, text-mining, and data mining
Excellent programming skills in C#
Able to work in Amsterdam minimally 1-2 days a week

mining,Indeed,p_541b6b0bb2f2ccc5,LegalTech Internship for Law students,ZyLAB, Amsterdam,"ZyLAB is an international company, located in the Netherlands in Amsterdam, specialized in eDiscovery. ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.

Many law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB. Due to the success of these internships, ZyLAB is looking for new students for 3rd year internships and 4th year graduation projects.

For who

This internship is best for International Law students (University of Applied Science) who:

have a good understanding of the legal aspects of for instance handling public records requests (“Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur” or WOB), the answering of regulatory requests or fulfilling subject access requests, and
are interested in applying legal technology to increase the quality and efficiency of such processes.

Location

The internship is at the office in Amsterdam.

Problem

LegalTech is more popular than ever. However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:

User adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),
Translating steps in the legal process into technology steps,
Legal defensibility and transparency of such technology,
Embedding technology in legal operations.

Many LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals. On the other hand, law books and case law use their own jargon, which is not understood by IT professionals and data scientists.

In order to bring these two worlds more together, this internship focusses on mapping the specific legal requirements of large information requests to the ZyLAB ONE eDiscovery software. Especially for business cases such as litigation, arbitration, subject access requests (GDPR), public records requests (verzoeken Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur – Wob), internal investigations, etc.

In addition, these internships should also document legal requirements needed to use technology for such processes and safeguard issues as privacy, security, and data protection at the same time.

Key challenges

The key challenges in this project are the mapping of legal terminology and requirements to that of the LegalTech world, AI and Data Science in particular. This requires a thorough understanding of all legal aspects of a certain application, as well as the ZyLAB ONE software, including its artificial intelligence and data science based machine learning and text-mining algorithms.

Research Questions

For a particular legal process, what are the specific requirement from a legal point of view when LegalTech is applied?
How can these requirements be embedded in the LegalTech process?
How can the requirements be audited and validated?
How can best practices best be document in a document, which is understood and accepted by both legal and IT professionals?

Other Expected / Desired Outcomes

The desired outcome is a well-documented best-practice guideline for the use of ZyLAB ONE software on a specific legal process.

mining,Indeed,p_8e80491e2209532a,Data Science Internship at Van Gogh Museum,ZyLAB, Amsterdam,"Data Science Internship at Van Gogh Museum

The Van Gogh Museum makes the life and work of Vincent van Gogh and the art of his time accessible and reaches as many people as possible in order to enrich and inspire them.

The van Gogh museum is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and has been using the ZyLAB ONE platform to manage various collections of background documentation. This includes but is not limited to: background information on van Gogh paintings and drawings, documentation of special exhibitions, correspondence, personal collections from van Gogh specialists, newspaper clippings about the van Gogh museum and van Gogh’s work, etc.

For who

This internship is best for computer science students looking for an internship or MSc graduation project in the fields of text-mining, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, data science or machine learning.

Location

The internship location is the Van Gogh Museum in the center of Amsterdam.

Problem

This particular document collection consists of scanned documents and corresponding meta-information. The meta information may not be complete or can be inconsistent. The van Gogh museum is interested in applying advanced artificial intelligence, data science and data visualization techniques to verify the quality of the meta information, to identify anomalies and to organize and clean up the archives. In addition, the museum is interested in integrating the content of the textual documents with other sources or information which resides in other content management systems. Finally, the museum wishes to understand how advanced information extraction techniques can provide new insights in the history of and relations between individuals, locations, organization and works of art of van Gogh and others.

All this requires a thorough understanding of the ZyLAB ONE software, but also of modern artificial intelligence, data science, text-mining, artificial intelligence and data visualization techniques algorithms.

Key challenges

The key challenges in this project are that text from some of the material is based on low quality document scans, these have resulted in a lower quality text generated by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.

In addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.

The information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.

Research Questions

The research questions in this research are:

How and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data
Which information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.
How can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.
How can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.
What is the quality of the results of these methods.

Other Expected / Desired Outcomes

The methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API’s, now and in the future.

JLT is looking for a marketing intern from January 2021.

JLT background

Our story starts in 1994. The Internet was new. Industrial computers were basic and 3G was still a dream. Over the following decades, JLT pioneered the rugged computing market. By taking design and quality to new levels, we brought the possibilities of computing to industries where a typical office machine might last just minutes. Today we are Sweden’s largest PC manufacturer, with over 100,000 computers shipped worldwide. But our mission remains the same as ever: we’re here to empower customers’ business by enabling hassle-free data communication in challenging environments.

We believe details make all the difference when it comes to rugged devices. That’s why we have our own engineering and manufacturing facilities in Sweden, enabling us to control every aspect of production with high precision. The result is that, without question, our customers can always count on quality. Additionally, JLT combines global resources with the agility of a small company. We take great pains to understand a customer’s operation and setup, and we go further than anyone to secure the performance they want. The performance of a rugged device is highly dependent on the ecosystem around it; everything from building layout to IT infrastructure plays a part. We understand all the complications and we’re focused on solving them for our customers. Drawing on years of experience and leading technical knowledge, we empower businesses and keep their operations running smoothly. Find out more at jltmobile.com

To solve the challenges of our customers, collaboration is key. We work together as a team and are closely involving customers and partners. For us personal leadership is about understanding your part in the greater whole and managing your own responsibilities in a way that creates harmony.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.

The next internship/graduation project is available:

Problem

“Data is the new oil (or gold)”. Recent progress in machine learning has shown exiting results in various text-mining applications such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), entity linking, but also in sentiment-, emotion-, and cynicism detection. Both traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Deep-learning models such as LSTM perform at levels well above human performance.

The solution to the above problems is no longer in the algorithms, but it is in the lack of (sufficient) annotated training data. Especially for less prevailing languages.

Manual creation of such data sets is too slow, too labor intensive and too expensive. In addition to this, human annotators are error prune, especially for the tedious and dreary work adding manual annotations. Sometimes, human annotations vary up to 40% for a given task.

Recent research indicated that certain machine learning algorithms such as SVM are very robust against wrong training data. Experiments where deliberately up to 30% of wrong training data was added to the training set, show that the classifiers were still able to reach similar results as classifiers trained with perfect data, albeit only a bit slower.

Based on these findings, this project focusses on creating such annotated training-data sets automatically. Various approaches exist already to do this:

Bootstrap a basic classifier with a small manually annotated data set and use this classifier to create larger data sets.
Use links / annotations / structure from Wikipedia to create annotated data sets.
Use Machine Translation to translate an annotated data set from one language to the other.
…

Creating a reliable process, including support for development of multi-lingual data sets is the focus of this project.

Key challenges

Key challenges are to design and test such a process. What are the best methods to start? What are the minimal boot strapping data sets required? Can machine translation be used to translate data sets form one language to another? How do we prevent data sets to contain too much wrong data? How can we measure when a data set is too polluted? Etc.

Research Questions

The following research questions have to be answered in this project:

How robust are well known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, CNN or LSTM to wrong training data? Does it only delay the training process or does it also create a lower maximal performance?
What are different methods and processes for (semi) automatic creation of data sets?
How good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values)?
How can these methods be used to create data sets for other languages?
What post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?

Other Expected / Desired Outcomes

At ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.

Development Environment

At ZyLAB, develop is done in C# in combination with HTML-5 based on the Angular-6+ framework.

Data Sets

ZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems. More information on other projects can be found here:

Compensation

Depending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you. We hear from our students that it is often 2—3 times higher than with other organizations.

In addition, we will reimburse your travel cost and you can participate in all activities we organize for our employees.

Work with JLT Mobile Computers in the marketing team to gain an understanding of the inner-workings and the requirements of a small but international company. Here is an opportunity to contribute to ideas that could reach a global audience, while refining and practicing your marketing, social media, and communication skills. JLT is looking for a marketing intern from January 2021.

JLT background

Our story starts in 1994. The Internet was new. Industrial computers were basic and 3G was still a dream. Over the following decades, JLT pioneered the rugged computing market. By taking design and quality to new levels, we brought the possibilities of computing to industries where a typical office machine might last just minutes. Today we are Sweden’s largest PC manufacturer, with over 100,000 computers shipped worldwide. But our mission remains the same as ever: we’re here to empower customers’ business by enabling hassle-free data communication in challenging environments.

We believe details make all the difference when it comes to rugged devices. That’s why we have our own engineering and manufacturing facilities in Sweden, enabling us to control every aspect of production with high precision. The result is that, without question, our customers can always count on quality. Additionally, JLT combines global resources with the agility of a small company. We take great pains to understand a customer’s operation and setup, and we go further than anyone to secure the performance they want. The performance of a rugged device is highly dependent on the ecosystem around it; everything from building layout to IT infrastructure plays a part. We understand all the complications and we’re focused on solving them for our customers. Drawing on years of experience and leading technical knowledge, we empower businesses and keep their operations running smoothly. Find out more at jltmobile.com

Work with JLT Mobile Computers in the marketing team to gain an understanding of the inner-workings and the requirements of a small but international company. Here is an opportunity to contribute to ideas that could reach a global audience, while refining and practicing your marketing, social media, and communication skills. JLT is looking for a marketing intern from January 2021.

JLT background

Our story starts in 1994. The Internet was new. Industrial computers were basic and 3G was still a dream. Over the following decades, JLT pioneered the rugged computing market. By taking design and quality to new levels, we brought the possibilities of computing to industries where a typical office machine might last just minutes. Today we are Sweden’s largest PC manufacturer, with over 100,000 computers shipped worldwide. But our mission remains the same as ever: we’re here to empower customers’ business by enabling hassle-free data communication in challenging environments.

We believe details make all the difference when it comes to rugged devices. That’s why we have our own engineering and manufacturing facilities in Sweden, enabling us to control every aspect of production with high precision. The result is that, without question, our customers can always count on quality. Additionally, JLT combines global resources with the agility of a small company. We take great pains to understand a customer’s operation and setup, and we go further than anyone to secure the performance they want. The performance of a rugged device is highly dependent on the ecosystem around it; everything from building layout to IT infrastructure plays a part. We understand all the complications and we’re focused on solving them for our customers. Drawing on years of experience and leading technical knowledge, we empower businesses and keep their operations running smoothly. Find out more at jltmobile.com

Working at JLT

At JLT we work from four values: customer empathy, collaboration, personal leadership and continuous improvement. Customer empathy is the starting point for what we do. To solve the challenges of our customers, collaboration is key. We work together as a team and are closely involving customers and partners. For us personal leadership is about understanding your part in the greater whole and managing your own responsibilities in a way that creates harmony. To meet our customers’ needs we have to look forward and keep advancing. Excellence is our journey, not our destination. Read more here.

These disruptions are not only vital to the future of humanity and our planet, they also open up immense opportunities for the businesses that drive them. The UN Global Goals and the Paris Agreement have set the targets we must reach to protect the earth and make sure everyone in the growing global population has a chance to prosper. But, so far, most change has been incremental. We need to transform economic systems much faster to hit the targets and stop the degradation of natural resources.
SYSTEMIQ connects the right people, ideas, technologies, and capital to transform economic systems. We do this through four five activities:
Convene and support coalitions of leaders to shape policies and business strategies that will rapidly transform economic activity
Work with companies that want to be pioneers in and drivers of change towards more sustainable systems
Co-create and incubate the market solutions most likely to build regenerative economic systems
Invest our own venture capital and expertise in opportunities with the biggest potential to drive rapid system change
Direct larger pools of capital into regenerative economic systems, so that these scale and multiply.

In order to deliver in these areas, we recruit and develop distinctive and varied individuals who strive to achieve our mission, challenge the status quo and act as change leaders.

With advanced problem-solving, analytical and relationship skills, you will be experienced working on strategy type projects to deliver breakthrough insights, action and results. Ideally your background includes working at a leading management consultancy or in a strategy role in industry, public sector or civil society. You are keen to work in a small company where you can play a shaping role and make an impact.
Our work includes
Through theEnergy Transition Commission, we bring together global leaders from across the energy landscape to define pathways to zero-carbon energy systems, galvanise leadership in the business community, and inform policy development.
We work with smaller business coalitions to create differentiated markets for low-carbon products and services – for example, the development of a low-methane natural gas market.
We partner with ambitious industry leaders to help them scope and seize the benefits of the low-carbon transition (e.g. assessing risks and opportunities of the energy transition for a mining company).
We join forces with innovators who propose distinctive, low-carbon solutions to accelerate their growth, like nuclear fusion and hydrogen-based aviation.

Requirements:
Masters or equivalent degree – Sciences/Sustainability energy related studies especially welcome
Data Science backgrounds strongly advantageous
1-3 or more years advisory/consulting/industry project experience in a high calibre and international environment, ideally working with industry, energy, manufacturing, or agricultural clients
Direct experience in the EV/Mobility/Energy sector is welcome
Problem-solving, analytical skills & collaborative team player with relationship management skills
Intercultural competencies that bring multiple perspectives to confront society wide challenges
Entrepreneurial spirit with the ability to identify opportunities and new initiatives and make them into reality
Comfortable with a level of international travel. This will vary depending on project but could be up to 20-30%. (however, we don't normally co-locate with clients and typically these are short term trips)
