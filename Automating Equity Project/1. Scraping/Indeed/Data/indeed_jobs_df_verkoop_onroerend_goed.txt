dilemmas in organizations, , Topic, , Under this large umbrella of managing the relationships with and among stakeholders for the good of society, there are quite a few areas of research you could consider studying, , , , While stakeholder theorists have long argued that stakeholders will be more willing to create value buy from the firm, work for the firm, invest in the firm when the firm adopts a stakeholder orientation, there is little empirical research about how stakeholders react to the different ways in which firms manage stakeholders A significant contribution would be to uncover the mechanisms underlying stakeholders reactions and explore the boundary conditions of the expected positive relationship between a stakeholder orientation and stakeholders willingness to create value, , Another topic wide open for investigation is organizations capacity to change their stakeholders beliefs and behaviours beyond their relationship with the organization While mostly depicted as harmful to society and often accused of greenwashing, organizations could have a much larger impact than so far recognized if some of their socially responsible practices are contagious and lead their stakeholders to also become more socially responsible It can happen on a surprising large scale as McDonalds transforming the production of eggs in the US by setting its goal of being entirely cagefree in the US by 2025 It can also happen on a smaller scale when employees learn more socially responsible behaviour at work and practice them in the private sphere, , , , While businesses and managers are often pictured as the big, bad wolves and stakeholders often pictured as the victims, the situation is much more complex when stakeholders have conflicting interests In such situations, managers have to navigate the powerful stakeholders pressures to put their own needs first in order to develop relationships with and among stakeholders that are better for less powerful stakeholders In this area, you could investigate, , , , , , While many people express the urge to see organizations become more responsible, stakeholders often fail to pressure organizations to change In particular, despite the moral outrage expressed in the media in the face of big scandals involving organizations eg the Volkswagens emissions scandal, customers often keep buying, employees keep working for these companies, investors keep investing or are back very quickly, etc It is a puzzle why stakeholders, who together could force organizations to change, so often fail to mobilize You could search for explanations at multiple levels individual, group, social norms and national cultures, , The list of areas is not exhaustive Other ideas of topics that fall within the broad theme of managing relationships with and among stakeholders are very welcome The first fourth months of your PhD will be dedicated to exploring potential topics for your PhD under the guidance from your promotor, , Besides the weekly interactions with your promotor, you can expect to be embedded in a very active research community The diversity and interdisciplinarity of the members of our department make the department a lively, creative, and intellectually stimulating place to conduct research, , Approach, , The PhD project will involve survey and experimental methods It may also involve qualitative work as an exploratory step to formulate relevant research questions and relevant hypotheses You could also choose for a mixed methods dissertation where some papers are quantitative and others qualitative, , Required profile, , We are looking for applicants, , , , Expected output, , You will write papers that together form the PhD dissertation and that can be published in toptier management journals The research group at RSM has a strong record publishing in these journals, which are listed on ERIMs webpage  targetblank relnoopener, , Cooperation, , To strengthen your international research network and complement your time at RSM, you will receive funding for a 3 to 6month research visit at a top international university Past visits have included Stanford, Wharton, Harvard, Florida, Chicago, Colorado, Cornell, Columbia, and UCLA, , The BusinessSociety Management department has strong connections with the international community of academics studying the different areas described above PhD students benefit from these connections, among others, in the form of access to academic expertise and invitations to workshops, , Members of the department are also well connected with executives in sustainable and innovative organizations, , Societal relevance, , By taking the point of view of society as well as the point of view of business, all members of our department do research that is societally relevant and contributes to RSMs mission to be a force for positive change in the world We expect this research project to be likewise societally relevant, by offering new insights into how to manage the relationships with and among stakeholders in ways that better serve stakeholders and societys needs, , Scientific relevance, , The PhD research should be highly original We also expect the research to be carried out with scientific rigor and the utmost integrity As such each paper of the project should be a significant scientific
