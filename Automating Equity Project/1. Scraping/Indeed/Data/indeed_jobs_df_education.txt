22,education,Indeed,p_90703e6963d883fa,Inside Sales,Effectory, Amsterdam Centrum,"It is Effectory’s goal to grow every year, in the Netherlands and abroad. To achieve this we need to reach out to more and more clients every day. And for this, we need you!
THIS IS YOUR JOB
As an Inside Sales Consultant, you will be the first point of contact to the prospects of Effectory. You will be utilizing various channels like phone, e-mail and LinkedIn to reach our prospect clients, but also following up on creative initiatives so you can establish and maintain contacts with existing clients. You will initiate a conversation with contacts of all hierarchical levels in the organization of interest and discuss which challenges they are facing. It is up to you to find the links between these challenges and our products, and further convince and advise your leads on managing their people by leveraging employee listening/feedback. You are fully responsible for qualifying the lead and determining whether it would be valuable to schedule an appointment with our Senior Sales Consultants. If that is the case, then you must ensure that both parties involved are provided with all of the necessary information in order to nail all calls and appointments, and ultimately contribute to a better conversion rate.

Your target group will mostly consist of HR professionals (CHROs, Executives, Directors and Managers) at leading-global enterprises. You will be highly proactive in your approach (that means contacting prospects who are not familiar with Effectory yet). It is therefore your responsibility to nurture them and strongly highlight our value proposition. Additionally, you will also be contacting warmer leads who have already expressed interest in our services (via downloading material from our website for instance). Therefore, it is vital that you are comfortable with both warm and cold approaches, and also working with monthly targets. You will work in close cooperation with the marketing team to determine which target groups, (geographical) regions and markets have the best potential. You will help them with setting up (online) campaigns so Effectory can gain better international traction. It is essential that you possess a growth hacking mindset, are a self-starter and are not afraid to take full accountability and responsibility. Furthermore, you must possess strong communication and interpersonal skills as you will participate in (daily and weekly) meetings to brainstorm and reflect with other team members, but also give each other feedback. Ultimately, you will be a main pillar of an international and self-managing commerce team with set monthly goals.

THIS IS YOU
You have enjoyed higher-level education and have 1-3 years of relevant work experience, preferably in an international inside sales role. You have a hunter mindset - you see opportunities everywhere, excel at engaging people, have a smooth writing style and possess solid (CRM) administration skills. You also like challenges and personal targets. You are not afraid to pick up the phone and you get a sense of intrinsic-satisfaction when acquiring new clients. You must be a good listener, information collector and interpreter, and are able to find linkages/correlation between customer pain-points and Effectory’s suite of products/offerings. We have no managers at Effectory and therefore your high level of self-support, responsibility, collaborative spirit and multi-tasking will make you a perfect match with us. You are a team player and are able to prioritize effectively. Since you will be supporting our international team and drive our international success, you must write and speak English at a (near) native level.

THIS IS US

Effectory – Europe’s leading provider of Employee Listening solutions – is a thriving company with more than 200 entrepreneurial, young and ambitious professionals who help organizations to collect feedback and ideas from their employees. Our mission is to make the working world a better place. Based in the center of Amsterdam, Munich, Malmö and Cape Town, our multi-disciplinary and self-managing teams collaborate with more than 1.200 clients in over 110 countries in ‘industries’ as varied as Retail, Production, Business & Financial Services and Non-Profit.


THIS IS WHAT WE OFFER

Temporary changes while working remote:

Work from home enablement: We facilitate chairs, desk, screens and support.
Stay healthy & fit: online yoga, meditation & HIT classes.
A lot of fun initiatives to stay connected with each other.
Structural transparent and interactive company updates about where we stand, where we are going while give stages to teams and customers.

A mentor to guide you through the onboarding phase together with an inspiring on-boarding program and a lot of nice workshops (on & offline).
Extensive professional and personal development opportunities, on and off the job.

This is your daily Action
Within the Commercial Operations department, we provide administrative support to our commercial departments. We guide the process starting from the quotation to sending the items from the distribution centers to the stores. You can think of checking quotations up to realizing the actual sample. Is something wrong? Then you contact the buying assistant or the supplier. The activities within Commercial Operations tie in with many other departments, such as buying, marketing, master data, the financial department and supply chain. About 150 new products are on Action's shelves every week. As Administrative Employee Commerce you check whether quotations match the invoices. Are the numbers correct? Do the amounts match? In addition, you work in the sample room, where you screen the products and you process characteristics of the products in our systems, for example, tax payments.
Meet your team
Commerce consists of the Commercial Operations and Commercial Development departments. Commercial Operations ensures that our buying activities are processed properly, and all data is accurately fed into our systems. These activities are vital in managing our operations, since our logistic, digital and marketing activities depend on it. Commercial Development safeguards our store format and is focused on optimising the way in which we get the customer to find our products in our stores. This involves analysing the format and layout of our stores, shelf layout, determining what items are promoted as well as monitoring the competitiveness of our pricing.

The clinic performs many clinical trials supported by a clinical trial unit, a fully licensed pharmacy for the production of novel drugs and cell-based therapies, and support for trial design, data management and analysis. Our website includes an overview of the ongoing research, the research groups and the research facilities (www.nki.nl).

Are you an enthusiastic, problem-solving Data Scientist who will thrive on unlocking data’s potential to inform decision-making, improve processes and ultimately add value as we deliver strategic objectives? Do you have an interest in technology, data, and the law – and do you like to embrace a challenge?

Then we are looking for you.

This role

In this role you will be part of our Know-How and Legal Technology team (Legal Operations), with a strong dotted line to our Client Relations team, all based in Amsterdam. You will divide your time between both teams. The Know-How and Legal Technology team is closely involved in legal matters for our clients and as part of your work for this team you will use your skills to improve efficiency in matters and legal processes, for example by building models to collect, analyse and integrate data from multiple systems.

As part of the Client Relations team you will be working on improving/automating reporting, identifying opportunities and answering strategic questions about Client Relations related topics such as pricing, business development and developments in the market. You will champion and demonstrate data science’s capacity to enhance our analysis, improve our processes, and inject valuable insights into operational and strategic priorities for both the firm, and its clients.

This is a role in which you will truly get to know the firm, working with lawyers, clients, business development professionals, senior management and other stakeholders throughout the firm. With optimistic objectives, and often tight timeframes, innovative thinking and an agile approach will enable you to coordinate the right mix of people, process and technology to meet and sometimes even exceed expectations.

This is a hands-on role, which will require you to be:

a consultant – acting as a sparring partner intentionally listening to the needs of the business, the lawyers, clients, and what is required of the data;
an expert – using your experience and technical ability to identify what could be possible; which data science strategy will deliver the best result; and optimising innovative solutions and an agile approach to deliver it; and
a team-player – liaising with lawyers and professionals across the firm, clients and third-party providers – to build a good rapport, inspire confidence, input your own expertise and involve the right people at the right time. You will be working with other teams to develop and manage processes, tools, and platforms to deliver seamless and high-quality solutions.

Unsurprisingly this role will require an eye for detail, and a meticulous approach as you scope, manage, deliver and report on the progress of projects. You will play a key role in developing and implementing best practice and sharing that information across the firm. You will have opportunities to provide in-house training to help colleagues better understand how data science can help in their respective roles.

In short, your skills and approach will help continually refine and enhance our efficiency and efficacy. This is an opportunity with plenty of room for growth and progression.

You

Do you recognise yourself in the following description?

You:

inspire confidence with an enthusiastic constructive approach and an approachable professional manner and the ability to listen?
build relationships quickly and act as a sparring partner with internal stakeholders at all levels?
have a multifaceted team, service and goal-oriented mindset?
are energised working in a high-paced, professional environment?
enjoy, and have, excellent project management skills, able to manage multi-disciplinary projects and juggle competing timeframes? have a keen attention to detail, able to pivot seamlessly from the raw data’s perspective, to that of our strategic objectives, and able to identify process improvements en route?
can map data – and understand how data maps across and within different applications and systems – so that you can harness that joined-up thinking to improve the overall efficiency and value of that data?
see yourself as a proactive self-starter, who is motivated to contribute on both the strategic and operational level?
display a strong and overarching commercial awareness, able to identify and maximise opportunities to use data science to enrich our decision-making, improve processes, and help deliver on strategic goals?

Do you have the following skills and qualifications:

a university education or equivalent experience and qualifications in a quantitive or technical field?
relevant work experience demonstrating your strong analytical and problem-solving skills in a comparable fast-paced professional environment?
expertise with data visualisation tools and a strong working knowledge of process automation using a scripting language (Python, R, SQL, VBA)?
a good command of English? (Dutch is also an advantage).

If so, we are confident that you could thrive in this role and we hope that the potential and responsibilities of this role inspire you to join us.

Act as a role-model for our Domestic Appliances behaviors: Customer first, Quality & Integrity always, Team up to Win, Take Ownership to deliver fast, Eager to improve and inspire
Business acumen / understanding in the broad spectrum of Domestic Appliances
Why should you join Domestic Appliances?
Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world.
In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
In its 128 year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.

206,education,Indeed,p_906589f491ed5549,Product Manager Infrastructure,Adyen, Amsterdam,"This is Adyen

We took an unobvious approach to starting a payments company, building a platform from scratch. Today, we're the payments platform of choice for the world's brightest companies. Speed is the foundation of our company. We think fast. We work fast. We launch fast. We are honest, direct, and try to have some fun too. We're creating our own path, with a global team driving sustainable growth. To maintain our momentum, we need people to join us in finding new ways of solving our unique challenges - people like you.


Product Manager Infrastructure

Adyen's payments platform and the Infrastructure team are growing at a fast pace. On a daily basis we ask ourselves: how do you maintain a payments platform which needs to process millions of transactions each day? How do you make sure that this platform is not only ready for today's volumes, but also ready for tomorrow's?

The Infrastructure team is responsible for exactly that; building out and maintaining the infrastructure which hosts our payments platform. An infrastructure which is required to be up 24/7, so merchants can always proces payments. On a daily basis the Infrastructure team works on a broad range of topics: from platform reliability to networking, and from data centers to big data platforms.

As Product Manager Infrastructure you will work with your technical counterparts on building and maintaining the infrastructure behind the state-of-the-art payments platform. You will primarily focus on managing large projects, prioritizing among different tasks, and making sure all teams and stakeholders are aligned. Stakeholders range from infrastructure engineers to software developers, and from product managers from other departments to the management team.


What you'll do

Coordinate across teams to move complex, technical projects forward, from their inception to launch.
Prioritize among different tasks, making sure that imminent problems are resolved first, but the long-term is also taken care of.
Establish ambitious but feasible goals together with the team and make sure they're being achieved.
Work with your technical counterparts to bring our internal infrastructure knowledge hub to the next level.
Make sure new engineers are quickly brought up-to-speed when joining the Infrastructure team.
Iterate on the organisation if required


Who you are

You are fueled by curiosity, always on the lookout to learn something new, whether it's payments, network topology, or data center deployment.
You love working together with engineers and enjoy helping them move their projects forward. You take pride in putting your team first, and you value the team over your own ego.
You don't sit around and wait until things happen by themselves. You go out there, from day 1, to get things done (even if that means giving the CEO a call in your first week).
You are eager to ensure that we do not waste time reinventing the wheel, even across teams.
You have a demonstrated passion for technology, either in a previous role, in your education, or in some sort of side gig.
Experience as a product- or project manager in an innovative tech company is a plus.
And ultimately, excellent written and verbal English communication skills are required, of course.


Who we are

Adyen is the payments platform of choice for many of the world's leading companies, providing a modern end-to-end infrastructure connecting directly to Visa, Mastercard, and consumers' globally preferred payment methods. Adyen delivers frictionless payments across online, mobile, and in-store channels. With offices across the world, Adyen serves customers including Facebook, Uber, Spotify, Casper, Bonobos and L'Oreal.


Our company culture

At Adyen our people are our greatest asset. Our unique company culture attracts the smartest people, who take initiative and ownership and can truly contribute to our fast growth. We believe that people reach the utmost if we give them freedom, opportunities and responsibility to build Adyen. Our culture is very informal and direct. We talk straight without being rude. We are extremely customer centric. We believe in teamwork, and don't like egos and hierarchy. When taking a decision we take them quickly but always involve others to further improve. We provide each other regular informal feedback and let everyone design their own growth path.

Are you driven to help ABN AMRO improve its role as a social gatekeeper to combat financial and economic crime? In addition, do you have an affinity with data to further fulfil this role within the Non-Financial Risk domain of our bank? Then Data Analyst is an interesting position for you within this department!

Your job
As a Data Analyst within the Non-Financial Risk domain, you make a crucial contribution to making relevant and high-quality data available to internal stakeholders and external regulators. From your role in the scrum team you will work together with various business parties (such as Compliance, Security & Integrity Management and the Detecting Financial Crime department) on the drafting of data related requirements. You develop these requirements into technical solutions and together with your team you make sure that these solutions are actually realized. It helps that you are able to deal with data and perform extensive data analyses. All data pieces ultimately form an information puzzle with which the bank has a correct picture of its customers at the right time and can detect and stop unwanted transactions.

Your working environment
The Non Financial Risk Data (CoDaC) team is part of the Risk Data & Modelling Grid. The ambition of the Grid is to optimize the risk data landscape, so that both our customers and ABN AMRO can do business with integrity. The CoDaC team is responsible for and engaged in collecting, transforming and integrating data to feed reports and enable analysis. At the same time, we are in a transition to a data platform on the public cloud (Microsoft Azure).

The atmosphere within the team and the department as a whole is open and informal. You will work in a diverse team with many different nationalities, and a good male-female and junior-senior relationship. We work hard, but there is certainly plenty of room for fun!

Your profile
You have affinity with the non-financial risk knowledge domain (fraud, terrorism financing, money laundering, etc.) and you know your way around in your search for the right data and analyzing it. Furthermore, you get energy from working with both the business stakeholders in the organization and the software developers in your scrum team.
Not only do you have a strong drive to continuously maintain your own expertise, but you also want to actively contribute to the further development and innovation of the field. You are also good at transferring your expertise to others and like to learn from your technical colleagues.

Do you think you fit in with us? Check your profile:
You have a completed Bachelor or Master education and at least 3 years of relevant work experience in a data environment
You have experience in analyzing data and defining logic
You have experience in data processing and data modeling
You have the skills to refine data requirements and dare to challenge stakeholders
You have proven experience in SQL, Python and/or Pyspark
You have experience working on Cloud environments. Experience with Azure is an advantage
Affinity with the non-financial risk domain is an advantage
You know and have experience with working Agile
What we offer
Given the attention paid by regulators to mitigating integrity risks and the responsibility we have and feel as a bank to bank with integrity, it is a challenging and responsible position. The success of our organization depends on the quality of our people and the ideas they have. We believe that new insights emerge from an interplay of cultures, knowledge and experience. Diversity is therefore very important to ABN AMRO.

In addition, we offer:
The ability to work flexibly (in terms of working hours, location, etc.)
Salary in line with the market
An additional benefit budget of 11%, with which you can buy flexible terms of employment (including vacations, contribution to telephone, (electric) bicycle and additional salary)
25 vacation days
In addition to the training budget for the department, you will receive a personal development budget of € 1,000 per year to be saved up to a maximum of € 3,000
An annual public transport subscription
A good pension plan

Vacaturenummer 21-155

The research group Cellular and Computational Neuroscience is part of the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) Neuroscience theme and investigates the regulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity at the membrane, cellular and network level using electrophysiological, pharmacological and molecular techniques.
We have three PhD positions in Neuroscience available.
Project 1: The effect of noradrenaline on the perirhinal gate in Alzheimer’s disease
The perirhinal region is a brain region that operates as a functional gate between the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. The ‘opening’ of this gate promotes memory encoding in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that this gate function is defective in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal of this project is to compare the functioning of the perirhinal gate between AD and control animals and to investigate the modulation of the circuit by noradrenaline. The experimental approach will use acute brain slices and employ voltage sensitive dye imaging, electrophysiological techniques, optogenetics, histology, pharmacological manipulation and in vivo behavioural experiments.
Project 2: Noradrenaline regulation of alertness through modulation of cortical synaptic function
In the brain, noradrenaline release raises our alertness, an intrinsic component of attention and consciousness. Noradrenaline modulates synaptic communication and neuronal network activity within cortical structures such as the prefrontal cortex and visual cortex. The goal of this project is to determine how the locus coeruleus (LC), via the release of noradrenaline, modulates synapse strength and consequently network activity in these brain regions to regulate alertness. The experimental approach will combine molecular, optogenetics and electrophysiological techniques on brain slices and in vivo to study how LC-activity controls synaptic communication.
Project 3: The link between Aβ-driven synapse and network alterations that cause memory impairment
Amyloid-β (Aβ), the prime suspect to cause Alzheimer’s disease (AD), triggers synapse loss and alters network activity. How the effects of Aβ on network excitability and on synapses are related is unknown. The objective of this project is to investigate how network and synapse changes depend on each other in an AD-mouse model. We hypothesize that these two Aβ-driven events reinforce each other to cause memory deficits. The experimental approach will combine molecular biology, electrophysiology and imaging techniques with behavioural tests to study the cause of AD-related memory impairment
What are you going to do?
You are expected to:
gain knowledge of the field through literature survey, discussion with team members, and internal lab meetings;
contribute to the design of experiments and perform experiments;
analyse and interpret results of experiments;
draft papers and write a thesis;
enrol in the training program for PhD students in the graduate school ONWAR (Graduate School Neurosciences Amsterdam Rotterdam);
teach seminars and/or practical for Bachelor and Master students;
supervise Bachelor and Master student projects.
What do we require?
We are looking for a highly motivated, ambitious and enthusiastic person with:
a Master degree in Neuroscience or equivalent;
analytical and theoretical skills as well as experimental talent;
a background in (cellular) electrophysiology (is an advantage);
appreciable communication skills, who communicates very constructively in a team-based environment;
excellent writing skills in English.
Our offer
We offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week, starting not later than 1 August 2021 (due to funding agency constraints) for the duration of 48 months (initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory performance evaluation it can be extended) and should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and Master students.
Based on a full-time employment contract (38 hours per week) the gross monthly salary will range from €2,395 in the first year to €3,061 in the last year. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants.

Why should you join Domestic Appliances?
Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world.
In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
In its 128 year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.

380,education,Indeed,p_d098dc0ef6e4bbc5,Application Security Specialist,Securify, Amsterdam Westpoort,"Curious and eager to learn, people work together at Securify to share their passions: application security, hacking and security research - with enthusiasm.
We are out-of-the-box thinkers and see possibilities for an attack where others would drop out. We never stop learning, and stay cutting-edge by continuously sharing knowledge amongst each other, experimenting with new techniques, and conducting our own security research projects.
From our office in Amsterdam we work collaboratively as a team. This way, we can reinforce each other and find a solution together whenever someone gets stuck on something challenging. This is exactly the power of Securify - when combined, we possess all the necessary knowledge and skill to make the impossible possible - while often surprising our clients with the most (if we may say so ourselves) brilliant findings!
If this sounds appealing to you too, and you see yourself working in a vibrant start-up environment where everyone is working side by side on extremely cool things and creating something big, then we would certainly like to meet you!
The Securify match
There is no catch-all diploma or certification for creative thinkers with a strong hacker mind-set. Our team, therefore, consists of players with different backgrounds. Software development, electronics, informatics, graphic design, mathematics, and even psychology. Oftentimes, it’s people who have immersed themselves into (software) security out of their intrinsic drive and passion!
At Securify we are fully focused on application / software security. In our view, this is by far the most important part of cyber security! It encompasses our most personal information, and the totality of most business operations. We even entrust software with our health and lives. It is everywhere, impossible to ignore, and growing at unprecedented speed. It is our mission to help companies build and use software in a responsible and safe way, put an end to the stream of large data leaks and incidents, and create a safer digital future! We need a bunch of passionate heroes for that!
Investigating the security of applications happens from the outside (hacking) but also from the inside - the source code. In here all details and secrets are awaiting you to really dive into the security core!
Because of this, it is important that you are at least comfortable with reading source code - or even better still - have programmed in the past (as a job or from your own interest or hobby). Some examples of profiles that fit perfectly within our team:
Security-minded software developers who want to fully specialize in security.
You have completed your studies in software development or IT and are strongly interested in security / hacking.
You already work as an ethical hacker but would like to work within our team to get even better.
Security-minded software testers / IT engineers who are comfortable with reading source code.

In short, if you are an experienced developer or security specialist, or are a talent yearning to learn more and wants to fully specialize with us through a paid traineeship, then we would like to meet you!
Your primary activities
You will be involved in performing security assessments (hack tests and code reviews) on mostly web and mobile applications. In many cases we also have access to the source code during our research in order to get a better view of the internal workings of an application and potential security problems. During your research you will work actively with your colleagues and you will regularly contact clients to report on the progress or escalation of critical findings.
Once you are completely up to speed, you will coordinate projects independently from beginning to end. This includes the intake, in which you discuss the wishes and correct approach with the customer and also the findings meeting where you explain and demonstrate your findings.
Research time!
Increasing our knowledge is paramount to staying ahead. Of course, you will gain a lot of new experience from your research, but we also spend a lot of time actively building our knowledge. You will, for example, work on internal (security) research projects, participate in CTFs, work on new tools, attend conferences and (give) internal presentations in which you or your colleagues demonstrate their research or spectacular findings of the week.
To give an impression of our vulnerability research projects - our team already discovered critical zero-day bugs in products such as: Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Cisco, WD, Oracle, Citrix, Apache, Amazon, Seagate, Viber, Pinterest and Dell. All leaks were reported and dealt with in a responsible manner in cooperation with these organizations. In this way we contribute to the better protection of the millions of application users worldwide.
Have a look here for an overview of all our discoveries. We hope that you will be next on that list as our new employee!
Your work environment
You will come to work in a cosy, informal environment with a team of likeminded colleagues, all of which are enthusiastically engaged in their passion. The work will be very diverse because our assessments are typically short-term (1 to 4 weeks). You work with many different techniques and organizations, from small to large. One week you might assess a new Internet banking portal whilst hands-on testing a new app from a smart start-up after that.
By far the majority of assessments are carried out from our office in Amsterdam. In the case that is not possible (technically) it could be that you will visit clients to carry out (part of) the research at their location.
We’ve taken the ""play hard"" part a little too far now too. So, go insane on the table tennis table, during a game of Foosball with colleagues, or fuzzing, playing on one of our consoles, Arcade (soon), NERF guns or our cuddly mascot Tight-Tiger if you need some inspiration or love.
A regularly occurring treat is our epic dinners with the whole team, and we close the week with a nice drink that we often combine with random talks from colleagues. These talks can be about all kinds of subjects such as security research, the most beautiful hack of the week, new exploits, useful tools, trips to security conferences, but also own hobbies such as (Jan) brewing beer.
Lunch is catered, fruit is available daily in abundance, and on ""Pattata Friday"" we all go out for fun together.

How we contribute to society
As a retailer, serving millions of customers in more than 1,700 stores across 8 countries, we are well aware of our impact on society and environment. That's why we invest in solutions and ways to reduce environmental impact, ensure sustainable production conditions and care about people in the countries where we have stores and produce products.
A few examples:
We aim to use more and more sustainable raw materials. Already 73% of our cotton products are sustainably sourced and 60% or our paper and wooden products come from sustainable timber. In 2025 this will be 100%.
Yearly we perform audits in our factories in Asia to check the compliance with our Ethical Sourcing Policy which ensures a responsible social and environmental approach to manufacturing.
We help to create safe homes for more than 1,500 children in SOS Children's Villages.
In the stores and DC’s we reduce as much energy and emissions as possible by using LED lighting, optimising our energy usage constantly and choosing more and more for renewable energy sources like solar panels or biodiesel.
Our people are at the heart of our success. We believe in the power of education and personal development, in giving people the opportunity to grow both professionally and as human beings. For example with our Action Academy, where we offer employees to develop themselves. In 2020 we created 5000 new jobs, over 1500 colleagues made an internal promotion and over 27,000 employees received training.
Our team is almost as diverse as our assortment. In 2020, over 50.000 employees with 125 nationalities made sure Action runs smoothly.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colourful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Cisco are always looking to identify talented people. If you are reading this posting then we may not have an open job right now, however it is highly likely we will in the future.

What are you going to do?
Within the framework of the NETWORKS Research programme several projects are available. One of these projects is 'Stochastic decision making for spatial problems'. This project covers decision problems in a spatial, stochastic setting. In this context one could think of e.g. delivery services, shared ride services, or various health-care related services. Typical problems could relate to assigning jobs to servers in a spatial setting, route selection and route adaptation (based on real-time information). It is envisaged that the project will combine, and extend, state-of-the-art techniques from stochastic modelling, optimization and machine learning. The project will likely consist of fundamentally-oriented subprojects as well as subprojects that involve more practical aspects, with explicit room for interaction with industry.
You can find all information about this position, the application procedure and the other projects within this call in this information package.

A Master’s degree in (applied) Mathematics, Statistics, AI or Operations Research;
excellent writing and communication skills in English.

Experience in teaching is a plus.
Additionally, you have to meet the mobility requirement of the MSCA which encourages transnational, intersectoral and interdisciplinary mobility. The mobility requirement states you may not have resided or carried out your main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the Netherlands for more than twelve months in the three years immediately before the starting date of your employment.
Our offer
We offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and Master students.
The salary will be €2,395 to €3,061 (scale P) gross per month, based on a full-time contract of 38 hours a week. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus.

Vacaturenummer 21-109

Are you fascinated by fundamental questions in the area of developmental, stem cell and cancer biology and looking for an opportunity to perform challenging research in this area? Would you like to investigate how the same molecular signals can be used over and over again with vastly different outcomes depending on the time and place of their activity? Are you eager to resolve the molecular mechanisms that control these tissue-specific signaling responses? This might be the chance to satisfy your curiosity. We are looking for a PhD student to study the tissue-specific initiation and interpretation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling.
You will be embedded in the Developmental, Stem Cell and Cancer Biology group (led by dr. Renée van Amerongen), which is part of the Cell & Systems Biology cluster of the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) in the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam.
Research in our group aims to understand how complex tissues are built and maintained. We study this at multiple different levels – 'from man or mouse to molecule' – using a variety of experimental approaches and with a specific focus on WNT signal transduction, mammary gland biology and breast cancer. See our website for more details: https://www.vanamerongenlab.nl.
The goal of this particular research project is to functionally dissect the cis-acting enhancers that control mammary-specific Wnt gene expression. This project is part of our larger research effort to understand the (epi)genetic regulatory mechanisms that allow individual Wnt genes to display dynamic, but tightly controlled expression patterns in different tissues. Time permitting, you will also help determine how the mammary-specific WNT/CTNNB1 target gene repertoire is activated as part of our larger research effort to understand how WNT signaling activates different gene sets in different tissues.
What are you going to do?
You are expected to:
use different experimental approaches (including molecular biology, (primary) cell culture, in vivo fat pad transplantation assays and proximity labeling techniques);
perform your experiments in a systematic and well controlled manner;
keep accurate records by properly documenting and organizing your work;
stay on top of the relevant scientific literature;
discuss your work in our lab meetings, incorporate feedback and also give input to others;
supervise BSc and MSc internship students;
combine your practical and analytical skills to write (and ultimately publish) one or more research articles as part of completing a PhD thesis.

You will get the opportunity to:
present your work at (inter)national meetings in talks or posters;
continuously hone your academic, professional and personal skills.
What do we require?
We require:
a recent MSc degree in the biomedical sciences (or a related area);
strong interest in developmental, stem cell and cancer biology;
affinity with Wnt signaling and mammary gland biology ;
affinity with gene regulation, chromatin biology and/or developmental enhancers;
affinity with (epi)genetics and molecular analyses;
high intrinsic motivation and aptitude for fundamental research (reflected by your training record);
an Art. 9 qualification (or the willingness to become Art. 9 qualified);
willingness to work with mice;
willingness to supervise BSc and/or MSc students during their research internship;
fluency in English.

Our ideal candidate:
works well independently, but is also willing to contribute to team efforts;
shows excellent professional and personal communication skills;
shows excellent organizational skills;
shows excellent critical thinking and problem solving skills;
has some proficiency with bioinformatics analyses and/or R;
has demonstrated hands-on experience with one or more of the following techniques: DNA cloning, CRISPR/Cas mediated (epi)genome editing, proximity labeling techniques, CHIPseq, mouse handling, histological analyses, confocal microscopy, FACS analysis, histological analyses.
Our offer
We offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week, preferably starting on 1 May 2021, for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended to a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and Master students.
Based on a full-time employment contract (38 hours per week) the gross monthly salary will range from €2,395 in the first year to €3,061 in the last year. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.
