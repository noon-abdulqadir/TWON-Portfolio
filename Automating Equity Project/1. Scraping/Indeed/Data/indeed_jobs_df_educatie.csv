supports this development and works closely together with the project ErasmusX, aimed at accelerating innovations in our educationBoth projects share the ambition to develop and support initiatives aimed at developing or strengthening impactdriven education, to design them in cocreation with faculty staff and societal partners, and to evaluate and refine them It is the ambition to organize the transition towards more impactdriven education in an evidencebased way, in which we systematically reflect upon the question which forms of impactdriven education fit in different disciplinary, educational contexts and how effective they are in teaching students how to create impact By sharing this knowledge, this research project can further fuel the transition towards an impactdriven

practices of impactdriven education asks for organizing safe environments in which pilots and experiments can be conducted It also asks for organizing processes of learning, reflection and improvement

educational innovations and to translate the resulting knowledge into mainstream practices put specific demands on the design of pilots and experiments This research project is meant to enhance our insight in how to organize educational innovation focused upon impactdriven education, and how to cross the difficult gap between the shelter of a range of experiments and the sustainable uptake in educational programsWe look for a researcher who is able to combine active involvement in designing impactdriven education with a keen eye to analyze in a systematic way how it works and how it can be

with the project ErasmusX, aimed at accelerating innovations in our educationBoth projects share the ambition to develop and support initiatives aimed at developing or strengthening impactdriven education, to design them in cocreation with faculty staff and societal partners, and to evaluate and refine them It is the ambition to organize the transition towards more impactdriven education in an evidencebased way, in which we systematically reflect upon the question which forms of impactdriven education fit in different disciplinary, educational contexts and how effective they are in teaching students how to create impact By sharing this knowledge, this research project can further fuel the transition towards an impactdriven university A community of learning will be developed to foster processes of learning and knowledge exchangeTo develop a strong knowledge base, to organize the cycle of developing, testing, evaluating and refining forms of impactdriven education and to make the step from exploration towards mainstreaming we are looking for two postdoctoral researchersSpecificationsDesign Principles for ImpactDriven EducationImpactdriven education is about teaching students to deal with societal issues, which are considered illstructured problems It builds upon the idea that students are able to take responsibility and to find out the most appropriate way to deal with the issue at hand Designing this type of education asks for more evidence about how learning tasks eg, scaffolding, learners eg, student agency, and learning environments eg, collaboration can be structured to create effective and impactful bachelor and master programs The research project has to result in a set of proven design principles for impactdriven educationWe look for a researcher who is able to combine active involvement in designing impactdriven education with a keen eye to analyze in a systematic way how it works and which principles can be discerned when it comes

Research Council NWO entitled Proactive Management of Antarctic Tourism Exploring the Role of Antarctic Treaty System ATS Principles and Values and Best Practices Beyond the ATS The consortium is comprised of TiU, Utrecht University and WUR The objective of the consortium is to develop knowledge for strengthening the proactive management of tourism within the ATS on four themes, each covered by a PhD or postdoc projectThe findings will support the position of the Netherlands within the Committee of Environmental Protection CEP and Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings ATCM by concrete, sciencebased proposals for Antarctic tourism managementWhereas the projects based at TiU and UU fall within the discipline of law, the two PhD projects at WUR are based in the social sciences and interdisciplinary researchPhD project 1 seeks to simultaneously address two issues that Antarctic governance is currently grappling with  the challenges that the growth of Antarctic tourism poses to the environment and scientific research capacity and the lack of resources for environmental research and monitoring  by tapping into the unique value that Antarctica represents for tourists The project will explore the viability of a system of tradable visitation permits for Antarctica, by reviewing the academic and political debates on restricting Antarctic tourist volumes making a systematic assessment of the available options for the choices concerning the cap, initial allocation, allocation to endusers and trade and simulating a range of possible systems of tradable visitation permits in order to test and evaluate their performance in the Antarctic context The project is embedded in the Environmental Systems Analysis group and the Environmental Policy groupPhD project 2 will map and understand the process of diversification of Antarctic tourism, study how this diversification relates to the fundamental values en principles of the ATS and, examine instruments of proactive management One of the objectives is to provide knowledge for the CEP process towards the development of a framework for conducting preassessments relating to novel tourism and other nongovernmental activities that raise particular concerns These would be derived from an exploration of the socioeconomic drivers of tourism diversification and its desirability, as well as the ability to find legal tools to regulate undesirable aspects This project focuses on the ATS principles and values that may be considered less tangible The project is done at the Cultural Geography GEO

Netherlands","['Nonprofit Organization Management', 'Health, Wellness and Fitness', 'Hospital & Health Care']","The Terms of Reference can be downloaded as a PDF MEDICAL HUMANITARIAN CONTEXTAdolescents 1019 years old comprise 233 of the total Zimbabwean population1 Among the many health challenges faced by this group, Sexual and Reproductive Health SRH, and more concretely teenage pregnancy, is of great concern The Demographic and Health Survey conducted by Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency in 2015 found that 216 of girls between 1519 years old had begun childbearing in Zimbabwe, and 122 in Harare2 About 36 of the overall pregnancies among adolescents in Zimbabwe were reported as unplanned being of concern that in most cases these pregnancies resulted in induced abortions generally performed under unsafe conditions3 In fact, about 10 of all pregnancies to Zimbabwean teenage girls end up in unsafe abortions UNFPA, 2016 The existing legal frame at country level ie, legal age of consent is 16 years contraceptive education and access is not allowed in schools seems to play, together with other factors, an important role in terms of barriers to SRH care for young people in Zimbabwe Vulnerable young people are often disadvantaged from many health programsMbare is the oldest and one of the most densely populated suburbs of Harare It was established in 1907 as a dormitory suburb for the working community during colonial era of Zimbabwe The suburb is highly accessible from most parts of the country and has a hive of activities The context gives the population unique characteristics that include high mobility, overcrowding and poor socioeconomic status leading to risky behaviours and higher vulnerabilities for adolescents and young people According to the 2012 Demographic Health Survey, Mbare is estimated to have a population of between 84,168 and 142,195 with 60 of them aged between 1024 yearsAs specific SRH needs for adolescents were identified during a genderbased sexual violence project run by MSF in Mbare, the organization decided in 2015 to initiate another project specifically targeting adolescents4 Its general objective is to reduce the morbidity and mortality for adolescents in Mbare and surrounding areas by improving access to an adolescentfriendly SRH package of care Its specific objective aims at piloting innovative and replicable models of SRH, HIV and TB prevention and care for adolescents, which could lead to policy changesThe project targets three subgroups of adolescents teenagers from poor socioeconomic context, adolescents at higher risk adolescents from key populations5, homeless adolescents and adolescents with disabilities, and adolescents living with HIV SRH services of the project cover three areas contraceptive care, antenatal care and postabortion care6, in addition to STI screening and treatment HIV services include prevention, ProviderInitiated Counseling and Testing PICT, selftesting, antiretroviral treatment including differentiated service delivery models and management of Opportunistic Infections OI In addition, other medical services were offered such as Primary Health Care PHC, Mental Health MH care, and psychosocial support in an adolescent friendly environmentIn terms of project activities, MSF is involved in the direct provision of sexual and reproductive care to adolescents in Mbare PolyClinic In addition, MSF rehabilitated parts of Matapi satellite clinic It is also currently running there a nonmedicalized youth hub offering health education, contraceptive care and income generation activities in partnership with other organizations At community level, MSF activities include Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health ASRH health promotion and education initiatives ie, School Health Clubs, and strategies to link and retain in care adolescents living with HIV and young people ie, mobile clinics to hotspots Some of these activities are conducted with the involvement of peer educators MSF also conducts capacity building activities for health staff of the City of HarareSince January 2016, a total of 16,500 adolescent beneficiaries received medical care in the facilities supported by MSF in Mbare From January 2019 to the end of September 2020, 102 adolescents received postabortion care 6,344 adolescents were sensitized through community peertopeer interventions In addition, two SRH digital health promotion campaigns were carried out, reaching 630,020 persons A roundtable with key MSF stakeholders is planned for the second trimester of 2021, to discuss the main project orientations for the next yearsREASON FOR EVALUATION  RATIONALEWhile adolescents represent a part of patients cohorts in MSF projects, the MSF experience in targeting them exclusively is quite limited This project represents a unique opportunity for MSF to reflect and learn about the specific enabling factors and challenges of adolescents health interventionsThe project strategy relies strongly on partnerships and collaborations with other actors including the delivery of health services This component of its strategy represents an additional element of interest, to be assessed and reflectedOVERALL OBJECTIVE AND INTENDED USEOVERALL OBJECTIVE is to assess the appropriateness, effectiveness, coverage, and connectedness of the MSF adolescent SRH intervention in Mbare and to identify the necessary adaptations for the next yearsINTENDED USE of this evaluation is aimed primarily at informing MSF Operational Centre Brussels OCB discussions to take place during the second quarter of 2021 about the projects main orientations for the next years, including potential necessary adaptations It may also be used by MSF and other actors potentially interested in reflecting on how to adequately address adolescents health in similar projectsSPECIFIC OBJECTIVESEFFECTIVENESSCOVERAGE To which extent do the medical activities reach the target population globally as well as more specifically to each subgroup Are there any factors that hinder project ability to reach the target populations and those most in need To what extent do beneficiaries have access to medical services provided by this project What are the main enabling factors to facilitate this access Is any targeted group excluded from the services provided by this projectCONNECTEDNESSEXPECTED DELIVERABLESTOOLS AND METHODOLOGY PROPOSEDIn addition to the initial evaluation proposal submitted as a part of the application, a detailed evaluation protocol should be prepared by the evaluators during the inception phase It will include a detailed explanation of proposed methods and its justification based on validated theoryies It will be reviewed and validated as

BIDContextThe African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption AUCPCC was adopted in Maputo, Mozambique on 11 July 2003 To date, the Convention has been ratified by 44 of the 55 Member States of the African Union AU Since adoption of the Convention, African states have made significant efforts in the fight against corruption including the establishment of national laws and the creation of anticorruption agenciesWhile the primary responsibility of tackling corruption rests with individual states, subregional frameworks are also necessary to address the scourge of corruption Article 192 of the AUCPCC requires states parties to Foster regional, continental and international cooperation to prevent corrupt practices in international trade transactions Further, Article 194 of the AUCPCC obligates states parties to work closely with international, regional and subregional financial organizations to eradicate corruption in development aid and cooperation programmes by defining strict regulations for eligibility and good governance of candidates within the general framework of their development policyIn response, Regional Economic Communities RECs have also developed anticorruption laws, policies, platforms and institutions to address corruption1 In respect to regional treaties, the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS adopted the ECOWAS Protocol on the Fight against Corruption and the Southern African Development Community SADC adopted the SADC Protocol Against Corruption At the East African Community EAC level, a Protocol on Preventing and Combatting Corruption was adopted, but it is yet to come into force Also, several regional platforms exist to address corruption including the Central Africa Network Against Corruption, the East African Association of AntiCorruption Authorities and the SADC AntiCorruption Committee However, a preliminary analysis of anticorruption standards and frameworks of various RECs reveals that there are varying levels of progress The imbalanced development of norms and frameworks are creating disparities in advancing anticorruption standards across the continent Conversely, an overdependence of development of subregional anticorruption treaties oftentimes contribute to fragmentation and divergence of anticorruption standardsAs a result, the Board, as the follow up mechanism of the AUCPCC of which all these RECs scribe, to is mandated in article 22 5g of the AUCPCC to build partnerships with among other intergovernmental organizations to facilitate dialogue in the fight against corruption and related offences To cultivate and promote such partnerships with RECs, the Board resolved to develop an Engagement Strategy which will promote synergies and harmonisation of efforts among the RECs and the Board in the fights against corruption on the continentFurthermore, in response to the call for a closer collaboration between RECS, the AU Commission and Member States, AU Policy Organs, adopted Decision ExtAssemblyAUDec1XI of November 2018 The Decision calls for effective division of labour among the AU, RECs, Member States and continental organisations, including African Union Advisory Board on Corruption AUABC As such, the envisaged Engagement Strategy is in part meant to give effect to this decision, with focus on guiding the collaboration and engagement on anticorruption matters between the Board and the RECs as well as strengthen the implementation of the AUCPCCIn this regard, the GIZ implemented Programme, Strengthening Good Governance and Human Rights in Africa  African Governance Architecture, in cooperation with AUABC seeks to recruit a Consultant to support the development of a RECs Engagement Strategy The overall objective of the service is to assess anticorruption developments across RECs and develop an Engagement Strategy for AUABC with RECs The Strategy will serve as a tool to guide engagements between AUABC and RECs in the fight

Research Council NWO entitled Proactive Management of Antarctic Tourism Exploring the Role of Antarctic Treaty System ATS Principles and Values and Best Practices Beyond the ATS The consortium is comprised of TiU, Utrecht University and WUR The objective of the consortium is to develop knowledge for strengthening the proactive management of tourism within the ATS on four themes, each covered by a PhD or postdoc projectThe findings will support the position of the Netherlands within the Committee of Environmental Protection CEP and Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings ATCM by concrete, sciencebased proposals for Antarctic tourism managementWhereas the projects based at TiU and UU fall within the discipline of law, the two PhD projects at WUR are based in the social sciences and interdisciplinary researchPhD project 1 seeks to simultaneously address two issues that Antarctic governance is currently grappling with  the challenges that the growth of Antarctic tourism poses to the environment and scientific research capacity and the lack of resources for environmental research and monitoring  by tapping into the unique value that Antarctica represents for tourists The project will explore the viability of a system of tradable visitation permits for Antarctica, by reviewing the academic and political debates on restricting Antarctic tourist volumes making a systematic assessment of the available options for the choices concerning the cap, initial allocation, allocation to endusers and trade and simulating a range of possible systems of tradable visitation permits in order to test and evaluate their performance in the Antarctic context The project is embedded in the Environmental Systems Analysis group and the Environmental Policy groupPhD project 2 will map and understand the process of diversification of Antarctic tourism, study how this diversification relates to the fundamental values en principles of the ATS and, examine instruments of proactive management One of the objectives is to provide knowledge for the CEP process towards the development of a framework for conducting preassessments relating to novel tourism and other nongovernmental activities that raise particular concerns These would be derived from an exploration of the socioeconomic drivers of tourism diversification and its desirability, as well as the ability to find legal tools to regulate undesirable aspects This project focuses on the ATS principles and values that may be considered less tangible The project is done at the Cultural Geography GEO
