A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

The special object you've been searching for, or a new and unexpected interest you never thought you'd have: the more you look, the more you'll find. And at Catawiki, there's always more to the story. Our experts value, authenticate and curate everything from automobiles to vintage stamps, so everything you encounter is real and layered with meaning - waiting to be found.

Our mission is to connect passionate enthusiasts with the objects that tell their stories. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, we help over 10 million people discover new treasures every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!
