24,application developer,Indeed,p_d098dc0ef6e4bbc5,Application Security Specialist,Securify, Amsterdam Westpoort,"Curious and eager to learn, people work together at Securify to share their passions: application security, hacking and security research - with enthusiasm.
We are out-of-the-box thinkers and see possibilities for an attack where others would drop out. We never stop learning, and stay cutting-edge by continuously sharing knowledge amongst each other, experimenting with new techniques, and conducting our own security research projects.
From our office in Amsterdam we work collaboratively as a team. This way, we can reinforce each other and find a solution together whenever someone gets stuck on something challenging. This is exactly the power of Securify - when combined, we possess all the necessary knowledge and skill to make the impossible possible - while often surprising our clients with the most (if we may say so ourselves) brilliant findings!
If this sounds appealing to you too, and you see yourself working in a vibrant start-up environment where everyone is working side by side on extremely cool things and creating something big, then we would certainly like to meet you!
The Securify match
There is no catch-all diploma or certification for creative thinkers with a strong hacker mind-set. Our team, therefore, consists of players with different backgrounds. Software development, electronics, informatics, graphic design, mathematics, and even psychology. Oftentimes, it’s people who have immersed themselves into (software) security out of their intrinsic drive and passion!
At Securify we are fully focused on application / software security. In our view, this is by far the most important part of cyber security! It encompasses our most personal information, and the totality of most business operations. We even entrust software with our health and lives. It is everywhere, impossible to ignore, and growing at unprecedented speed. It is our mission to help companies build and use software in a responsible and safe way, put an end to the stream of large data leaks and incidents, and create a safer digital future! We need a bunch of passionate heroes for that!
Investigating the security of applications happens from the outside (hacking) but also from the inside - the source code. In here all details and secrets are awaiting you to really dive into the security core!
Because of this, it is important that you are at least comfortable with reading source code - or even better still - have programmed in the past (as a job or from your own interest or hobby). Some examples of profiles that fit perfectly within our team:
Security-minded software developers who want to fully specialize in security.
You have completed your studies in software development or IT and are strongly interested in security / hacking.
You already work as an ethical hacker but would like to work within our team to get even better.
Security-minded software testers / IT engineers who are comfortable with reading source code.

In short, if you are an experienced developer or security specialist, or are a talent yearning to learn more and wants to fully specialize with us through a paid traineeship, then we would like to meet you!
Your primary activities
You will be involved in performing security assessments (hack tests and code reviews) on mostly web and mobile applications. In many cases we also have access to the source code during our research in order to get a better view of the internal workings of an application and potential security problems. During your research you will work actively with your colleagues and you will regularly contact clients to report on the progress or escalation of critical findings.
Once you are completely up to speed, you will coordinate projects independently from beginning to end. This includes the intake, in which you discuss the wishes and correct approach with the customer and also the findings meeting where you explain and demonstrate your findings.
Research time!
Increasing our knowledge is paramount to staying ahead. Of course, you will gain a lot of new experience from your research, but we also spend a lot of time actively building our knowledge. You will, for example, work on internal (security) research projects, participate in CTFs, work on new tools, attend conferences and (give) internal presentations in which you or your colleagues demonstrate their research or spectacular findings of the week.
To give an impression of our vulnerability research projects - our team already discovered critical zero-day bugs in products such as: Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Cisco, WD, Oracle, Citrix, Apache, Amazon, Seagate, Viber, Pinterest and Dell. All leaks were reported and dealt with in a responsible manner in cooperation with these organizations. In this way we contribute to the better protection of the millions of application users worldwide.
Have a look here for an overview of all our discoveries. We hope that you will be next on that list as our new employee!
Your work environment
You will come to work in a cosy, informal environment with a team of likeminded colleagues, all of which are enthusiastically engaged in their passion. The work will be very diverse because our assessments are typically short-term (1 to 4 weeks). You work with many different techniques and organizations, from small to large. One week you might assess a new Internet banking portal whilst hands-on testing a new app from a smart start-up after that.
By far the majority of assessments are carried out from our office in Amsterdam. In the case that is not possible (technically) it could be that you will visit clients to carry out (part of) the research at their location.
We’ve taken the ""play hard"" part a little too far now too. So, go insane on the table tennis table, during a game of Foosball with colleagues, or fuzzing, playing on one of our consoles, Arcade (soon), NERF guns or our cuddly mascot Tight-Tiger if you need some inspiration or love.
A regularly occurring treat is our epic dinners with the whole team, and we close the week with a nice drink that we often combine with random talks from colleagues. These talks can be about all kinds of subjects such as security research, the most beautiful hack of the week, new exploits, useful tools, trips to security conferences, but also own hobbies such as (Jan) brewing beer.
Lunch is catered, fruit is available daily in abundance, and on ""Pattata Friday"" we all go out for fun together.
Job requirements
Required
Creativity, hacker mind-set.
Drive and passion for software/application security.

Proficient verbal and written communication in English.

We are a well-funded 4-year-old scale-up with a steady growth curve comprised of 25 enthusiastic people. The dev team consists of 6 and is expected to double during the next year (currently 1 senior backend developer and 1 backend developer).

The parts of the tech stack you would be working with

We have a core api (PHP 7.4) with supporting microservices (all Python 3.8) and React based frontends. We are now looking for someone who can work on the Python microservices predominantly. It is a plus if you can work on other parts of the stack.

We have also opened up our API to external partners and the first integrations are up and running.

There are some things we do not do, like unproductive merge/pull request discussions regarding coding standards and style which we avoid by enforcing them in CI. Instead, we always welcome improvements regarding architecture, programming, and operations practices: anything that strengthens our workflows.

Experience with Agile software development is a plus. Think of Scrum, Kanban, TDD, DDD.
Continuous integration, automated deployment and working in a DTAP holds no secrets for you.

58,application developer,Indeed,p_570fc53d2bae5fa1,Junior and Medior Ruby developers,Springest, Amsterdam,"We never work with agencies, recruiters or freelancers, so please don't contact us about that. Thanks!

At Springest, our mission is to help people reach their full potential through learning. We’re making our platform the best source for learning products in the world. We’re looking for both junior and medior developers to join our 10 person Product team.

Learning is what we’re all about, and as a developer, Springest is the best place to grow. Since we’re a data driven company, let’s listen to two Springeteers who walked your path:

Iris Kuipers, joined Springest 5 years ago as a junior developer:
""I joined Springest as green as grass, just out of a one month coding bootcamp from Codaisseur. With hardly any coding experience, they gave me the opportunity to grow working on small and large projects with awesome mentorship from the senior developers and product owners.
Springest has provided me a safe space to learn from my (and others') mistakes and take time to try out new things while working on challenging projects that impact the learning journey of others. I love that!""
Onur Kucukkece, joined Springest 1,5 years ago as a medior developer:
""Before joining Springest, I was very excited and nervous because they have a very different management approach. When learned more about Springest, Springeteers and Holacracy, my concerns were replaced with admiration. I realised that we are not only helping people to reach their full potential but we also do the same for ourselves.
Springest has given me the chance to learn from and work with many skilled developers and product owners. I got to choose the areas which I want to improve my skills, and enough space to try new things out. I felt my personal growth and happiness is one of the company’s top priorities: no happy customers without happy employees :)""
What does the Springest Product development team do?

We have a very strong product focus. We’ll always strive to find long-term and scalable solutions to our users’ needs. The platform revolves around the millions of yearly visitors of our Dutch, German, Belgian, Swedish, UK, and US sites. Thousands of learning providers use it to promote their products and gather reviews from course participants. Besides these public sites, many large organizations like KLM, PostNL, T-Mobile, Siemens, Aegon, BAM, Vattenfall and RWE use our B2B platform: ""Springest Go"".

We need your help!

In the past 10 years, we’ve scaled our platform to receive hundreds of thousands of transactions every year. It began as a public marketplace. By now, Springest Go has gradually grown into an equally important part of the ecosystem as Springest Public. So the nature of our development work has also changed.

We’re balancing roughly two types of development projects. The core platform, with its projects to improve our search engine, user experience, transaction flows and admin backend for over 10.000 education companies. And projects to satisfy the needs of specific corporate customers: often integrations with internal systems or first-time solutions to problems we then want to abstract to other customers. Both present their own types of development challenges for you.

As a junior or medior developer, you’ll initially work on customer-focussed projects. The senior developers will mentor and guide you in them. Sometimes that means learning how seemingly small or boring parts can fit into a huge platform. Gradually, you'll build up ideas on how to decrease the technical debt introduced by all these odds & ends.

Your contributions, meanwhile, will help free up the senior developers to work on long-term improvements to our architecture and infrastructure. They are eager for you to join and grow!

What’s the Springest learning platform you’ll be building?

Both these public marketplaces and customizable SaaS B2B platforms contain all kinds of learning products: from on-site trainings to books, from coaching sessions to e-learning courses, and from professional events to years-long educations. We help our users discover, compare, and book everything they need to reach their personal and professional learning goals.

In the Learning sector, most of the budget comes from organizations. Talent needs to be developed. Employees need business-critical certifications. And these days, people expect a modern web experience for internal applications as well: complete & secure data, personalized recommendations, and user-friendly booking experiences. Yet, corporate software solutions often need to support complex internal & financial flows.

We love this challenge. The more organizations we help out, the more scale we have in achieving our own purpose: helping people reach their full potential.

About working at Springest

You can find most information on our Join Springest homepage. For you as a developer, it’s important to know we don’t have managers, but very clear roles, accountabilities & processes. You’ll learn and get to take responsibility, very useful for your entire career in tech. At Springest, you will work in close collaboration with product owners, marketing, and sales colleagues. You are also a full member of the development team, in which we discuss architecture, infrastructure, and keep a close watch on security and performance.

Working in our product development circle

Our main application runs on Ruby on Rails backed by Postgres, Redis and Memcached. Next to that we rely on Elasticsearch to power our search, which is a core part of our product. We also have some smaller Go and Elixir projects in production. We are hosted on AWS and make heavy use of their offerings like RDS, CloudWatch, Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 Container Service. For our frontend stack, we work with Slim, Sass & CoffeeScript. Some libraries we use are jQuery, Bourbon/Neat, Backbone, and these days we are transitioning more and more to Vue.js. But mainly, we care about using the right tool for the job!

As junior developer: we expect you to have at minimum 1 year of professional experience as a Ruby developer. We don’t expect you to have experience with the entire list of technologies mentioned above, or even a big part of it. We do expect you to roughly know what those terms refer to, and to have some professional or hobby experience with some of them (or their alternatives). More importantly, we expect you to be able to have a conversation with us about what in that list excites you, what you would like to grow in, and how you think they might relate to our platform & codebase.

As a medior developer: we expect you to have 2 to 4 years of professional experience as a Ruby developer.

Anyway: next to our main application, we build internal tools when necessary. This ranges from ticketing systems for our Learning Advisor and Provider Support teams, to apps for mapping our organizational structure and announcing important updates. It is rewarding for us to see small development projects make a big impact for our colleagues.

We also do a regular internal hackday where we drop everything and work on something completely different. We might give a new programming language a shot, try out an idea someone’s been toying with for a while or hack on some actual hardware. A lot of hackday ideas actually became super important for our business. Check this recap of a hackday to read more about why we organise them.

What we also expect from you
You work well in a team, and want to make the team greater than a sum of its parts.
Engagement in what it is that you are building and who you are building it for. We want you to feel involved and come up with ways to make Springest better.
The drive to improve yourself and our organization and deliver high quality work.

Your job

They may say that you are a front-end professional, but you would rather see yourself as a well-rounded Software Engineer. You have a creative mind with an eye for quality and know your way around frameworks like Vue.js. You wouldn’t want to call yourself a Full-Stack Engineer but you know enough to have an informed discussion on how to properly build an API.

You will be part of a product team that, together with Designers and other Software Engineers, creates and maintains interfaces used by millions.
Funda will provide you with an environment that gives you flexibility to learn on the spot while asking you to share that knowledge at the same time.

Your team

You will work with the Insights Team, which is responsible for enhancing part of the funda experience so all house buyers can find their ideal home. The goal is to offer users everything they want to know about the property and the area in which it is located.

Solid knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript
Experience with Vue.js

Heavenly chair massages 6 times a year (at the office, during working hours).
Chef-prepared fresh lunch every day (when you’re in the office), ranging from soups to salads, fresh bread rolls from the baker and a snack every Friday.
Dinners, team outings, drinks and a birthday present. And during lockdown periods, funda offers great virtual alternatives.

You will be working on the hugely popular Citation Generator (2M users per month) and other tools that help students graduate!


Full-time · Amsterdam


What is Scribbr?

We are a family of graduates with one mutual goal: Help students graduate!

Scribbr helps more than 500 students daily with our Proofreading & Editing service, the Scribbr Plagiarism Check, and hundreds of articles about academic writing (with over 5 million monthly pageviews).

With our HQ team of 60 in the heart of Amsterdam and more than 500 freelance editors worldwide, we do everything we can to provide the best service for students. We pride ourselves on our hard work and continuous innovation, and it shows: we're one of the fastest-growing technology startups in the Netherlands!


About the job

You will mainly be working on the next version of the Citation Generator. With 2 million users per month, it's the most popular citation generator globally. Best of all, it's completely free to use! Our goal is to increase that number to 20 million monthly users, and we're full of ideas to make the generator even better. One example: online collaboration features so that students can work on their reference list simultaneously. You can become the person who makes this possible!

You will also work on existing tools, and you'll be at the forefront of brand new Scribbr services.


The stack

At Scribbr, we use all kinds of technologies. The Citation Generator itself is written in Vue, the back-end in Symfony. We want to replace this back-end with a new version in Node.

Other in-house technologies we love include React, Symfony, TypeScript, Cypress, Styled Components, Jest, Doctrine, PHPUnit, and many more.

Our motto: we choose the stack that suits the idea and the solution.


Our ideal candidate
Has at least four years of experience in the profession
Has broad technical interests
Likes to work with a team
Has demonstrable experience in writing single-page web applications
Has demonstrable experience in writing back-ends
Is located in The Netherlands

Attention to good design is certainly a plus.

What do we offer?

A yearly salary between €40,000 and €55,000

A development team with mainly senior developers who are happy to mentor you

Enormous responsibility and freedom

An excellent codebase (especially for a startup!)


Complete autonomy for the development team (no investors!). Do we need to refactor? Go for it!


Access to the TNW network to share knowledge


A high-performance laptop, two screens, noise-canceling headphones, and whatever extra hardware you need (yes, you can use it at home during this pandemic too!)

Budget for training, certifications, conferences, and tech gadgets

A fun, ambitious, informal, flexible work environment that embraces the latest technologies

Due to COVID, we are all currently working from home, but we usually work from an office with a view in the center of Amsterdam.


25 paid holidays (+7 official Dutch holidays)


The chance to join one of the fastest-growing startups in the Netherlands   


Travel cost reimbursement

30% ruling assistance, if applicable


And of course... Friday beers, (corona-friendly) team activities, a Scribbr boat docked outside the office, smart colleagues, free lunch, etc. ;-)


The technical landscape of Scribbr

The technical side of Scribbr can be roughly divided into three categories: Houston, the marketing website, and tools.

Houston is the epicenter of Scribbr. Here a team of 6 developers works on the management system where all orders, customers, and operations come together. Main techniques used: Symfony & Vue.

With more than 7,500,000 visitors per month (and increasing!) and a team of 13 marketers, the marketing website is developed in WordPress.

The tools, such as the Citation Generator and the Citation Checker, have been developed with different techniques (including Vue and React) with a strong focus on the front-end.


You will be working on the latter (tools, tools, and more tools)!

Who will you be working with?

We're enthusiastic, we're international, and we love to celebrate success! We work together to ensure that students are delighted with our services and that Scribbr keeps on growing.",-1,-1,https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=4707bbffb82c4fa1&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=6ce52de1f491cd9c&assa=4770,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=4707bbffb82c4fa1&fccid=b259d1e2a70b9639&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-02-07,en,No,No,information and communication,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,J,0.27586206896551724,0.7241379310344828,0.3275862068965517,0.6724137931034483,Mixed Gender,Mixed Age

Our Frontend story

When the site grew exponentially so did the need for properly structured Frontend. A major effort was spent modernizing our stack and properly structuring it so that it is scalable, maintainable, and predictable. It has a nice balance in that we can iterate fast but still be confident on features/changes that we release. It is an ongoing process, so we constantly look into new ideas and ways on how to improve our stack every day.

Here's Bora, one of our Engineers:

""I always wanted to have a job where it's not only about coming to work because ""I have to"", but also because I enjoy it and find it purposeful. Having so many talented people around and a direct impact on the experience of millions of our users - I can surely say that it's finally possible! All of that in a fast-paced environment with a top-notch stack: React, TypeScript, and the world of microservices.""

So what's the job

Working in a high traffic environment you will have the opportunity to build new features to grow the business and measure the impact. We are highly data-driven so A/B experimentation is at our core. You will be part of the frontend guild which is distributed across multiple teams consisting of a Product Owner, UX designer, backend, and other front-end developers.

You will also work with the frontend guild on constantly maintaining and improving our infrastructure to keep the stack being scalable, maintainable, and predictable. We are open to new and fresh ideas and you will have the opportunity to display them at our guild meetings where we openly discuss them.

How we roll - Our Stack

On most of the codebase, you will be working with TypeScript (our primary choice for writing Frontend code), React, Redux. Our code is built with Webpack. The code architecture is based on the Feature pattern and we are testing our code using Jest. For static content, we use Rails with Haml. We style our code using SCSS with the BEM methodology.

The stack and architecture that we have right now has been chosen by many frontend developers spending a lot of time in our codebase. We think it works really well for us, but as with everything we are always up for new ideas.

We still have some parts of the code which are in our outdated stack. We are continuously working on migrating those to the preferred one.

You'll move in sync with

You will be part of one of the product teams. Given their domain (Search & Discovery, Payments, Onboarding, etc.) you will work closely with all of the team members in sharing your expertise by explaining how/if things should be done and how will it affect the user experience.

A little about you

It's likely that you know how to explain a problem and a solution, both in detail to a technical crowd and in a simplified way to the not so technical folk. You know how to organize your time to be efficient without being overworked, and are calm and collected when a problem arises in production, and are great at prioritising your work. In addition, you have a proven track record in the following:

JavaScript and/or TypeScript - we can bring you up to speed with TypeScript
Experience with React or Vue is preferred
Redux or any other state management tool
Styling while using the BEM methodology or any of the modern approaches with using PostCSS for CSSinJS, CSS modules etc.
Functional and Object-oriented programming paradigms
Unit testing
Build automation, webpack/rollup

We don't like to re-invent the wheel so we use a lot of open-source software or write code we can share and re-use internally.

What are we looking for:

At least 2-3 years of experience with building API’s with Laravel.
Good understanding of CI/CD workflows and shipping applications to production.
Self-starting mentality; being pro-active and able to thrive in uncertain and ambiguous environments

Challenges teammates and asks questions about architecture and product decisions
High level of autonomy and responsibility


What is in it for you:


The rare opportunity to build a world-leading platform
Extremely driven, optimistic and smart engineers
High level of transparency
Tons of experimentation, and a very fast-moving environment
An office overlooking the Rijksmuseum in the heart of Amsterdam

COMPANY INFORMATION
What is MYPO?
MYPO is a smart parcelbox that allows consumers to receive and return packages effortlessly (www.mypo.nl). However, the company is not a parcelbox manufacturer, we leave that to our production partners. Our company is a tech-startup, the core of our business is the combination between our cloud platform that connects carriers and consumers, and our smart-lock. The lock can be used for all types of parcelboxes, for example built-in models in new buildings, or a steel box in the garden. The MYPO app than sends the relevant tracking information to the smart lock, receives notifications when a package is delivered and lists all of your (online) orders.
Why did we start MYPO?
No longer than a year and a half ago MYPO was just an idea, born out of our own personal frustration with receiving packages. Additionally, we believe that MYPO can bring a revolutionary change to the delivery industry. With a smart parcel box, it is possible to deliver packages at night, when cities are empty, and deliveries are more efficient and less polluting.
Where do they stand right now?
Since we started in 2015, we have developed several prototypes and produced our first pilot series. Everything has been developed inhouse: from the PCB design and firmware to the cloud platform. During the past six months we ran a pilot in Rotterdam for the first 25 users together with our partners (DHL and KPN). The results were positive and consequently MYPO received an investment of 500.000 euro for bringing our technology to the market. There is currently a lot of interest from corporates as well as municipalities.
Where are we going?
In 5 years, MYPO will be the number 1 supplier of ""Smart Parcel Lock"" solutions (hardware, application and platform). In addition to selling our own Parcelbox, we provide and integrate our technology with various construction companies (house front models) and parcelbox manufacturers. All this while bearing in mind that we want to contribute to the creation of a delivery system which is easy to use for consumers and carriers and less damaging for environment. The first step is to extend the team and develop a marketable platform, smart lock and customer-friendly app.",-1,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=f251d1fc590c4688&fccid=2ea8bca700d719f1&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-02-07,en,No,No,construction,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,F,0.125,0.875,0.47619047619047616,0.5297619047619048,Male,Mixed Age

However, the vacancy will likely open up again in a while, so if you feel like being on the radar for the future, we'd still love to hear it.

We never work with agencies, recruiters or freelancers, so please don't contact us about that. Thanks!


At Springest, our mission is to help people reach their full potential through learning. We are on a journey to make our platform the best source for learning products in the world. From on-site trainings to books, coaching sessions and e-learning courses: we help our users discover, compare, and book everything they need to reach their personal and professional learning goals.

We have a strong product focus in which everything revolves around the millions of yearly visitors of our Dutch, German, Belgian, UK, and US sites. On the supply side of this marketplace, thousands of learning providers use our platform to promote their products and gather user reviews. Meanwhile, a growing number of organisations like ING, PostNL, T-Mobile, Siemens, Aegon, Nuon and RWE use our SaaS learning platform internally. This allows us to make a positive societal impact at scale, by helping people take ownership of their own professional & personal development.

Yes, it's a complicated business. But that is exactly why this challenge is so cool: we have spent years building a uniquely strong team, business model & product. Now we need your help to go from scale-up to... big scale-up ;)

Working at Springest

We are looking for a senior Frontend Developer to join our product development team. We don’t have managers, but roles, accountabilities & processes. We feel that individuals taking responsibility is very important. At Springest, you will work in close collaboration with product owners, marketing, and sales colleagues. You are also a member of our development team where we discuss architecture, infrastructure, and keep a close watch on security and performance.

Our main application runs on Ruby on Rails backed by Postgres, Redis and Memcached. Next to that we rely on Elasticsearch to power our search, which is a core part of our product. We also have some smaller Go and Elixir projects in production. We are hosted on AWS and make heavy use of their offerings like RDS, CloudWatch, Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 Container Service.

For our frontend stack, we work with Slim, Sass & CoffeeScript. Some libraries we use are jQuery, Bourbon/Neat, Backbone and Vue.js. But mainly, we care about using the right tool for the job! In our product development flow we often use tools like Balsamiq and Sketch for designing features. As a Frontend Developer, both your creative & technical input can help to refine the output.

Next to our main application, we build internal tools whenever necessary (but only if necessary!). This ranges from ticketing systems for our Learning Advisor and Provider Support teams, to apps for mapping our organisational structure and announcing important updates. It is rewarding for us to see small development projects make a big impact for our colleagues.

We also do a regular internal hackday where we drop everything and work on something completely different. We might give a new programming language a shot, try out an idea someone’s been toying with for a while or hack on some actual hardware. A lot of hackday ideas actually became super important for our business. Check this recap of a hackday to read more about why we organise them.

Some of your challenges

Helping to craft the user experience for a big but inspiring challenge: building a future-proof social learning platform
We like to learn and we like to teach: you will be helping your full-stack-y colleagues become full-stackier, by sharing your valuable experience, improving standards and improving styleguides
many more... (curious about our roadmap and long-term vision? If you're interested in the job, we'd love to share and hear your thoughts)

What we expect from you

You work well in a team, and want to make the team greater than a sum of its parts.
Engagement in what it is that you are building and who you are building it for. We want you to feel involved and come up with ways to make Springest better.
The drive to improve yourself and our organisation and deliver high quality work.
You have a broad interest and deep knowledge. We are all about learning and sharing knowledge.

Nice-to-have's:

You have experience writing server-side code (we mainly write our code in Ruby/Rails).
You have experience as a visual designer.

Yolt is a leading Fintech that started in 2016 in the Innovation Office of ING building a smart money platform leveraging the power of PSD2 and Open Banking with two distinctive business propositions. Yolt, the smart thinking money app, is on a mission to empower everyone to be smart with their money. After launching in the UK in June 2017, then in France and Italy in 2018 we quickly reached 1 million registered users; giving them all the tools to spend smart, save smart, and reach their goals. In 2018 we created our second business line with Yolt Technology Services (YTS), exposing our open banking capabilities with companies across Europe. We live and breathe our core values: being frontrunners switched on and trusted.

Yolt App

We encourage and inspire people to think differently about money, to take control, and adapt to life’s twists and turns. In other words, Yolt does the hard work, so our users can Unthink money. Yolt is the multi-award-winning app that makes managing money, easy. Our smart thinking money app gives users a clear overview of their connected bank accounts, credit cards and spending together in one place.

Yolt Technology Services (YTS)

Yolt Technology Services connects banks, aggregating data, and initiating payments, with further features in the pipeline. To further empower the whole financial ecosystem, Yolt Technology Services is now offering these services to businesses as a technical enabler for their propositions. Yolt Technology Services has been one of the key drivers of the open banking ecosystem in the UK, currently driving over 25 million API calls per week, and is taking the same role in Europe under PSD2.

This job asks for a candidate that can switch easily between operational tasks (working with the team to refine the stories) and more client-related work (communicating with clients for support).

Communicate with clients on reported issues and expected resolution time;

111,application developer,Indeed,p_9fa037852201fa8b,Full Stack Engineer,PlusOne homerun, Amsterdam,"We're looking for a curious and product-driven developer to help evolve, design and strengthen the Homerun product experience.


Full-time · Amsterdam
Homerun is a hiring tool for small businesses with big hearts.

We believe small businesses are some of the most interesting and meaningful places to work. What they lack in size, they make up in creativity, purpose, and character. But most small businesses are still struggling with boring job posts, full email inboxes, messy spreadsheets, and scattered resumes. That's because most hiring tools are made for scale-ups and big corporates with experienced recruiters, not for busy teams at small companies.

For these companies, we are building a modern hiring tool that embraces personality, creativity, teamwork, and community.

Our product is an all-in-one tool that lets teams publish beautifully styled job posts and customized application forms and also communicate with candidates and review candidates together as a team. All from one simple and beautiful app. Homerun is hugely successful in The Netherlands and now it's time to let the entire world know we exist.

The job
Your work varies day-to-day. You'll be responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of features for our main product. One day you'll work on building a real-time notifications system and the next day you'll be refining our existing state management in Vue.js to make it easier to work with.

You write elegant code that others can easily understand. You also don't shy away from explaining your design pattern choices to co-developers so that everyone can learn from it. You're also continuously improving the UX and you have a keen eye for design. You feel comfortable taking responsibility for any step in the product development cycle. Waiting to be told what to do is not your style.

Who we're

looking for
We are a small team, where communication, teamwork, and camaraderie are a must to build a successful product. We are looking for an experienced web developer with the necessary skills to style HTML buttons but also design the best structure to store our customers' precious data. Even though we are heavy users of Laravel and Vue.js frameworks, we prefer to work with people that understand that tools are just tools, not the main goal. Pragmatic solutions are preferred over following a dogma.

Curiosity is king. We want you to be independent and positive, a problem seeker, and a problem solver. You're an all-rounder with a small ego who values free time outside work just as much as work itself.

Some personal skills we value

A natural curiosity for new technologies and tools.
A mindset that always pushes you to say ""this could be better"" - and then execute on it.
The ability to communicate your thoughts in a way that everyone understands.
Strong verbal and written communication skills (English)


As for development skills

At least 5 years experience developing web application in publicly available production environments and experience working on large SPAs.
You know how to write clean, readable, reusable, and scalable code both in PHP and JavaScript. Automated testing is part of your daily toolbox.
You're not afraid to refactor legacy code. In fact, we expect you to have experience migrating legacy systems.
Experience working in a multidisciplinary team with designers, product managers and other developers.
Bonus points if you know a thing or two about AWS and infrastructure.

Most of the problems we're solving today with Homerun did not exist a year ago. That's why we value a pro-active attitude above any other skills or experience.

First six months
Our team consists of 15 talented people working in development, design, marketing and customer success who are ambitious and want to inspire each other.


Everything we do is new - we are a young company - which makes it exciting and challenging. Most of the time you will be working just outside of your comfort zone, which is exactly where you learn the most. And since we're a small team, you get a lot of responsibility and therefore have the freedom to work on what you think is best.

You will be a part of the Development team and collaborate closely with the Customer and Product teams to make Homerun work as smooth as possible for our customers.

In your first month
You'll gain the basic knowledge to work with the rest of the team and be aware of our tips and tricks. Deploying our application to production is part of your daily routine already, and you'll create a list of improvements you would like to apply to our product, process, and way of working.

In three months
You'll perfectly understand our processes and standards, and you've most likely proposed changes based on our previous experience. You will have a clear understanding of our business and customers/users, you will be able to manage your tasks in an autonomous manner and you might have even started managing small features.

In six months
You'll feel like you've been a part of Homerun since forever and Ted (our plain weird dog..see below) will be part of your coffee break conversations. You will be more than ready to take full responsibility for new features, issues coming from support, propose new architectures that will make our lives easier as developers, and make customers even happier, you name it.

You'll do all this while along the way sharing your experiences and learnings with the team and with the outside world.

Impact
Your work will be viewed and used by hundreds of thousands of people. Everything you do has a direct impact on the daily workflow of thousands of Homerun users. Over the last three years, we've built up quite a nice club of companies that use Homerun, among others:


Team
We're an ambitious bunch who inspire each other to have fun and do their best work.

You'll join a diverse group of Polish, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Brazilian board game enthusiasts, foodies, gamers and coffee experts (just to name a few). We love for everyone to bring their full selves to work and feel comfortable doing so. That's why there's plenty of opportunity to get to know each other on a personal level and why we make it a point to always speak English.

As most of the team is currently working from home due to COVID-19, we find creative ways of keeping the fun alive that we normally have playing ping pong, during afternoon drinks and other shenanigans in and around the office.

Tech stack
Laravel, Vue ecosystem, Webpack, Redis, MySQL, ElasticSearch, AWS, Terraform, Pusher, and SendGrid are the most important bits of our stack.

Don't take us wrong: we're not married to any of these technologies. Even better: we would be more than happy to get your expert opinion on what technologies are more fitting for our unique use-cases. That's why we're working on replacing our AngularJS code with Vue.js, for example.


Perks
We believe that a balanced mind and body is what matters most. We don't want to compete with big corporates on lease cars. This is why we're offering a range of perks and benefits that represent who we are a bit better.

Join us on a mission to turn the principal consumer generation into the principal invested generation. Our psychology towards finance can be summarized with one phrase “Wait Til I Get My Money Right”. More than 90% of Millennials say financial security is a top priority and 83% want to play an active role in their finances. But less than 30% of their wealth is invested in stocks while nearly 80% don’t invest at all, making Millennials the least invested generation in history.Tired of archaic and inefficient loyalty programs not living up to your expectations? Tired of accumulating points and miles that expire or are never enough? It is time to rethink rewards and loyalty. It is time to think about ownership mentality. Fractional shares mean you are part owner of brands like Amazon, Google, Tesla for as little as $1.With any method of payment, you earn Bits of Stock™ on purchases with your favorite brands and build wealth that reflects your spending habits. Bits of Stock™ automatically rewards you with fractional shares of stock without the annoying activities of uploading a receipt or scanning a QR code each time you make a purchase. And btw, you get them for free.At the same time, global brands spend $100 BNs annually on loyalty programs while 50% of that spend goes to waste - points are unused, miles are unredeemed, and personalization is lost.

Location: 100% Remote

Company:

Doctor Evidence builds solutions used by doctors, educators, scientists, researchers, biomedical informaticians and manufacturers that enable enormous advances for the improvement of human health, including COVID-19 research. DRE offers a fast-paced, pioneering environment, dedicated to serving our clients as well as improving our society for example through our membership of the Trinity Challenge. Our goal is to build an ambitious and energized team, committed to our mission and focused on implementing the latest technology according to the highest standards, but balanced with a respectful, nourishing work environment and lifestyle.

DOC Search:

DOC Search™ is a specialized medical search engine that is built on advanced artificial intelligence technology and calibrated with over 15-years of large proprietary data training sets curated from over 80-million data elements from over a hundred thousand digital study groups. Our database currently contains more than 33 million items, generating 1.1 million concepts and 2.6 million terms. DOC Search™ exhaustively searches all the global literature derived from continuous indexing of PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, DailyMed, EPAR, WHO-ICTRP and individually selected global health-related RSS feeds.

DOC Search™ is used to generate comprehensive insights in real-time from global medical literature and data. The system enables users to quickly mine scientific literature for answering medical questions and discovering related concepts in the literature for landscape analysis, including KOL profiling.

Position:

We are looking for an experienced Front-End Engineer to contribute to the next generation of our applications. You should have a good eye for design and detail, and an aptitude for tackling user interface and workflow challenges unique to big data analyses and complex scientific workflows.

Your teammates are in Europe, but most of the stakeholders are in the USA.

As a Front-End engineer, you will be working on the front-end development of the client application and user interface. You will work closely with our scientific product leads, bioinformaticians, Machine Learning experts and back end developers on developing tools and visualizations that support large-scale, sophisticated data analysis and interpretation. You will take a leading role to help shape the UI look, design, and feel of our applications.

A good fit would be a developer who can execute quickly while still following best practices and who thrives on new technology and has an avid interest in bioinformatics and big data. You will be expected to help make decisions on and implement design, behavior, functionality, and styling of our applications. Experience with healthcare, bioinformatics or life sciences is nice to have, not required, but experience building web-based user interfaces and applications with complex, data-driven visualizations is a must.

And be forewarned: This a challenging domain. We are not building standard, run-of-the-mill React or Angular applications. Our applications are built using substantial innovative custom technology to accomplish unique on-the-fly statistical and AI analysis of massive amounts of research data. It requires understanding of direct browser APIs to achieve necessary scalability and performance requirements. But you will have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions and innovations in an emerging field of technology.

Skills & requirements

Technical Requirements:

Strong attention to detail and visual design; please expect to share examples of previous work.
Exceptional CSS, HTML, and JavaScript skills.
Experience with Clojure(script)
Easily choose or write the best algorithm for consuming large, dynamic data sets.
Experience designing beautiful web applications.
Familiarity with modern development workflows and release cycles, using Agile-like methodologies.
Comfortable with Git and modern JS development tools.

Experience Requirements

You have strong communication skills and willingness to ask questions. We do not write implementation specs for you; you will be a business problem to solve and are expected to understand and explore the space of design alternatives to come up with a solution. Questions will occur and it is important that you be comfortable asking them and chasing down answers.
You have extensive experience with web development, having done one or more substantial client/server applications.
You can take any documented API and immediately begin building client-side functionality.
You’ve done enough projects to identify what’s missing or unworkable in a wireframe or high-level set of design requirements and have the basic design and UX chops to improvise when necessary.
You know how to optimize website resources and front-end performance for data heavy JavaScript apps.
You are well-versed in the classic front-end skills as well — you know your selectors, semantic tags, and cross-browser development.

Vacaturenummer 21-052

The Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) and the Department of Media Studies of the Faculty of Humanities are looking for a research software engineer with a background in machine learning, knowledge engineering and/or digital humanities, to join the industry collaboration (KIEM 2020) project From Books to Knowledge Graphs.
This project is a collaboration among UvA (Dr. Giovanni Colavizza), the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (Dr. Matteo Romanello) and the publisher Brill, which aims to develop an open framework to extract knowledge graphs from scholarly publications using Brill’s classics catalog as a case study.
Project From Books to Knowledge Graphs
The scientific publishing industry is rapidly transitioning towards information analytics. This shift is disproportionately benefiting large companies. These can afford to deploy digital technologies like knowledge graphs that can index their contents and create advanced search engines. Small and medium publishing enterprises, instead, often lack the resources to fully embrace such digital transformations. This divide is acutely felt in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Scholars from these disciplines are largely unable to benefit from modern scientific search engines, because their publishing ecosystem is made of many specialized businesses which cannot, individually, develop comparable services.
In this project, we aim to start bridging this gap by democratizing access to knowledge graphs – the technology underpinning modern scientific search engines – for small and medium publishers in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Their contents, largely made of books, already contain rich, structured information – such as references and indexes – which can be automatically mined and interlinked. We plan to develop an open-source framework for extracting structured information and create knowledge graphs from it. The framework will be released with a commercial-friendly license to encourage its re-use. We will as much as possible consolidate existing proven technologies into a single codebase, instead of reinventing the wheel.
What are you going to do?
As research software engineer you will:
help designing an information extraction pipeline which extracts structured entity information from scholarly publications (e.g., references and indexes) and performs entity linkage, in close collaboration with industry partners (Brill);
develop such pipeline, by re-using existing solutions or developing novel ones;
test and apply the pipeline on Brill’s classics publication catalog;
document work and code via comments, tests and technical documentation;
publish code and data openly and support early adopters in re-using them;
assist and take an active role in the execution of other project-related activities (e.g., outreach).
What do we require?
The following is required:
a degree in a related field, including but not limited to digital humanities, computer science, machine learning, knowledge engineering. Alternatively, a humanities (or other) degree with proven experience in research software engineering;
excellent written and spoken English;
proved capacity to design, develop and document research software. While the project members mostly use the Python stack, other options are also possible.

The following is preffered:
previous experience with machine learning, and in particular information extraction tasks (Named Entity Recognition, entity linkage, etc.;
previous experience with knowledge engineering;
a PhD in a related field (Computer Science, Machine Learning, Knowledge Engineering, Digital Humanities see above);
an interest in the SME publishing sector;
an interest in Classics and/or digital humanities.
Our offer
You will be appointed as Research Software Engineer, ufo-profile ICT developer, for 19 hours per week (0.5 FTE) for a period of 12 months at the Media Studies Department of the Faculty of Humanities. Remote work is the default, given the current situation. The starting date of the contract is 1 April 2021. The gross monthly salary (on full-time basis) will range from €2,790 to €4,012 gross per month, depending on experience and qualifications, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus.

We make it as easy as possible to send and receive secure messages on the Zivver platform, that’s why you do not need to create an account to read messages you received. Our guiding philosophy is that usability is a key component of security - and from this many interesting challenges arise.

Our platform is a SaaS application written in Scala that serves our Angular Typescript web application and C# Microsoft Office plugin (yes, we like strong static typing). Your job is to develop new applications and features using Angular/Typescript.

You’ll be working in a dynamic, international scrum team. Zivver is scaling up fast, so your developing skills will not only be pointing towards our code but also towards your colleagues.

You don’t want to touch plain JavaScript, not even with a 9ft pole
Every byte counts
You feel comfortable using a battle tested Javascript library that exists for more than 2 months
You once wrote a leftpad function yourself

A day at HQ

(We are living during a pandemic, so there’s no such thing as a day at HQ. We fully support a work-from-home situation (read as monitors, headphones, webcam, docks, and whatever else you might need). In normal times though...)

It’s Friday 9.00 am when you storm into the office. You’re all about action today, but before anything happens: coffee! You update your action list and head straight to the End-User Web daily standup. People are not in the mood to talk today, as it’s the final day of the sprint and everyone wants to get things done. So after this very brief update, quickly back to your desk.

This two-week sprint was all about “business rules”. We're giving power to the user to validate if updated business rules are actually more effective. That feedback is used by our system to fine-tune these rules. We're building a new UI from scratch to support this and it has been exciting to be involved in the design from day one. The challenge we're solving this sprint is trying to give non-technical users the tools to help us refine very complex and technical content detection algorithms. You want to enter the Retro this afternoon with a clean action list, so you really need to finish updating the API service and making sure all events are logged to the audit log by 15.30.

After returning from lunch at the Humming Bar you hit a dead end; a migration script is broken. You quickly discuss and fix the problem with Jeroen, and luckily it’s all smooth sailing from there. Later, at the Retro you raise the issue you ran into. There are no expectations or boundaries on what can suggested to improve so you can be truly open and honest.

By now it’s 16.30 and you’re off to the weekly Beer & Demo session, where every week a different colleague shares what cool stuff they’ve been working on. It’s a great way to close off the work week, keep up with developments in this fast moving scale up and have a beer at the same time.

You are proud to work on solutions that make funda cash flow run even faster and have an impact in a field that needs some serious optimising. Despite Covid-19, funda is growing and we’re even creating new teams, like the Advertising Team. You can embark on a new and exciting adventure with us, to help make funda a premium advertising platform in 2021.

We can only achieve what we aim to by making conscious choices. It comes down to which advertisers we want to focus on and how to optimise our platform for products and services. That’s why we’re looking for driven, multidisciplinary and smart people. People like you. People who enjoy a technical challenge, an enormous range of tasks, and building and deploying features from start to finish using continuous delivery. And yes, we know Fullstackers have many job opportunities. So do your colleagues, and yet they work at funda because they want to work with the smartest people at a financially strong company. What about you?


Your job

We don’t expect our Fullstack Developers to do two jobs at the same time. The great thing about this job is that the work is versatile, and that you have the chance to keep diving into something new. The challenge for you lies in the fact that we’re no longer a start-up and do have structure, but we need help professionalising. You will work on:

Optimising ad channels and focusing on content, context and first-party data
Mortgage leads automation: we have limited insights into performance and conversions at the moment and want to change that
Optimising our header bidding process
Post cookies solutions: machine learning optimisation, Universal IDs and publisher clean rooms are definitely opportunities to explore in the coming year

Your team

You’ll be part of a brand new and small core Advertising Team. This team further consists of another developer and a service owner. You will report to your Lead Engineer, Andries.

174,application developer,Indeed,p_a5cde59d83ae3987,Software Engineer (Team Agents),Funda, Amsterdam,"Funda is on the lookout for amazing developers to join our team. If you want a job that is impactful, modern and touches the lives of everyone in the Netherlands, this is it. You will write code that gets viewed 77 million times per month, be involved in one of the biggest decisions in people’s lives—buying somewhere to live—and you will actively participate in ideas on how to make this journey better.

Your job

We’re looking for someone to help strengthen what we call the makelaars (agents) teams. Since funda is a marketplace, it has two big parts, supply and demand. The makelaars teams take care of our customers who mostly work on the supply part. In your general day to day job you would probably write code in C# (latest .net core) that will get deployed several times a day to our Kubernetes cluster hosted in Azure. You might have to find out how to refactor some legacy code or deep-dive into some business logic that nobody remembers anymore.

Since quality is very important to us, the code you write is generally unit tested and written with DDD in the back of your mind. You might get tagged in a couple of PRs that you need to review, or you might need to test something for a colleague. All the code we ship is tested in one way or another. We have frontenders who specialize in frontend but you will be responsible for the backend. Some of the problems you might solve are “How do I extract this old logic into microservices while being iterative in my approach?” or “How can I make my awesome team even better?” If things like the 12-factor app, clean architecture, DDD or Event Driven Architecture get your fingers tingling with excitement, then get in touch!

Your team

As a Software Engineer, you will be part of a Scrum team, consisting of a Product Owner, UX Designer, multiple Engineers and an Agile Tester. Together, you will focus on an area of expertise. There will be plenty of room for new ideas, experimentation, trial and error, and on-the-spot learning.


Your profile

You’re proactive, eager and results-driven. Due to your strong technical knowledge and enormous drive, you are the perfect addition to the team and you easily motivate others. Furthermore you recognize yourself in the following requirements:

You work and think like someone with a Bachelor/Master’s degree
You have a minimum of 5 years' experience in a similar job position
You have experience building (high-volume) professional-level website
You know how to work with Microservices, C#, Dotnet core 5 (latest version), Kubernetes and Microsoft azure

192,application developer,Indeed,p_e0c0acd65e04637f,Scala Backend Engineer,YOLT, Amsterdam,"Our mission

We’re on a mission to give everyone the power to be smart with their money. We encourage and inspire people to think differently about money, to take control, and adapt to life’s twists and turns. In other words, Yolt does the hard work, so our users can Unthink money. We live and breathe our core values: being frontrunners switched on and trusted.


Our app

Yolt is the multi-award-winning app that makes managing money, easy. At the forefront of innovation enabled by PSD2 and powered by open banking technology, our smart thinking money app gives users a clear overview of their connected bank accounts, credit cards, and spending together in one place. After launching in the UK in June 2017, then France and Italy quickly reached 1,5 million registered users; giving them all the tools to spend smart, save smart, and reach their goals.


What we’re looking for

We’re after enthusiastic, driven individuals who want to want to contribute to our journey and grow with us along the way. Can you hit the ground running? Do you have the drive to go faster? Fintech is fast-paced, but we always remember to switch off too.


What you’ll be doing

As a Scala Backend Engineer, you play a key role in the development and operation of machine learning applications. You are an ambitious, enthusiastic software developer, who enjoys designing, building, testing, and maintaining complex data-driven applications (check out this PyData talk for an example use case here). Challenges around microservices, performance, scalability, and concurrency excite you, and you know how to manipulate and transform data. You may have worked with low-latency distributed systems before, or you have read about them and tried some things out for yourself. Being a good programmer with a strong theoretical basis, nobody has to explain to you the details of KISS, DRY, YAGNI, and the GoF OOP design patterns. You have some experience in functional programming, know its core principles, and are excited to work with Scala libraries such as ZIO. But foremost, you are able to write clean, correct, efficient, and maintainable code.


You have affinity with machine learning and actively liaise with Machine Learning Engineers, to make sure models are served in production in a streaming microservice environment (Scala, Kubernetes, Kafka, Cassandra, AWS cloud services). Building on your knowledge of solution architectures, you help design all aspects of automatically retraining machine learning systems (Airflow, AWS SageMaker). Because your applications impact real users, you will not rest assured unless they are embedded in fully-tested CI/CD pipelines and properly instrumented (Prometheus, Grafana). Last but not least, you are aware that proactive communication with other teams that produce input data, consuming model outputs, or build cloud infrastructure components is crucial for success.
Our Backend Engineering Chapter

You are part of the Backend Engineering Chapter. Within the chapter, we foster a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning, facilitating you to keep abreast of the latest developments in the field. You signal impediments to the Head of Engineering and advise on the adoption of new tools and frameworks. To get inspired and expand your network, you attend meetups and conferences, where you also regularly showcase your work that enables Yolt users to spend and save smarter.


What you’ll need
A proven track record in delivering production-grade data-driven applications
Good social and communication skills
A solid technical background e.g. a degree in the field of software engineering
More than one year of project experience with Scala programming
Experience with microservices architectures and (part of) the Yolt tech stack: Cassandra, Kafka, Kubernetes
Proficient English speaking and writing skills


What you need to know about us

You'll join a small, dedicated team of highly skilled people who are committed to changing the way people think about money. We operate in a unique space on the boundaries of a large multinational bank, ING Bank N.V, but with the energetic, fast-paced attitude of a start-up with offices in Amsterdam, London and Katowice. We don’t like to brag, but we’re proud of the fact we’re leveraging the power unleashed by PSD2 and open banking to deliver the most innovative money app out there, recently winning the coveted ‘Best personal Finance App’ at the 2020 Wealth and Finance Fintech Awards.


The perks

Flexible hours
A challenging and diverse job, with the potential to keep developing yourself
Work with an impact on a real product, helping real people
Learn from other experienced data and backend engineers
Work with the latest cloud and streaming data technologies
Competitive salary and benefits
Inspiring, entrepreneurial environment with an ambitious vision for the future
Supporting, fun-loving team of highly skilled people
A challenging job within a future-forward Fintech committed to creating a movement of positive disruption with trusted origins from ING, one of the most innovative banking organizations",-1,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=e0c0acd65e04637f&fccid=3f56872a8b26fee4&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-02-07,en,No,No,information and communication,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,J,0.27586206896551724,0.7241379310344828,0.3275862068965517,0.6724137931034483,Mixed Gender,Mixed Age

197,application developer,Indeed,p_62af0b93133d40e6,Senior Java Developer,MetaFactory, Amsterdam,"Working at MetaFactory

We offer challenging work for senior developers. We think that every senior software developer can and should work full stack. We work with a modern development street (Jenkins, Git, Jira, Sonar, Maven). We follow and work with Angular. Senior developers have to connect with modern developments thus they get time to research new tools and new frameworks. We execute our projects through small and close scrum teams with experienced senior developers.

Most of our software development projects are carried out in-house. Our projects vary from Web based applications to IOT solutions. Next to executing projects we at MetaFactory have developed the MetaFactory development tool. With the MetaFactory tool we create our “personal/company” meta programming environment that stimulates the creation of elegant programs. We have no project leaders. We are all senior developers, work according to scrum and everybody is responsible for finishing his stories and communicating about the progress made.
MetaFactory: tool and company

The Tool: Using MetaFactory for the development of Java applications leads to a shorter development process, less maintenance and a higher overall quality. The big difference between MetaFactory and MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) tools is the fact that MetaFactory allows developers and architects to maintain complete control over the code. It is the developer or architect who decides what code is generated, not the tool. As a result, developers keep a firm grip on the performance, the design, etc. With MetaFactory you create your own meta programming environment. That helps them create Java code, XML and everything that comes with it. MetaFactory has been built over the course of ten years. It is now ready to be adopted by large groups of Java developers. In order to meet their requirements and respond to their ideas we need Java developers.

Our company: which like the tool goes by the name of MetaFactory, is based in Amsterdam Sloterdijk. With a small team of Java developers and salespeople we sell and develop in house projects for our customers. Besides projects we develope our tool and will make the work of Java developers even more interesting than it already is!

What can you expect from MetaFactory?
The chance to improve the daily work of Java developers
A state-of-the-art Java development environment, including the MetaFactory tool
An agile development environment
The energy, challenges and culture of a young company
An attractive salary and compensation package
The office is excellent located in Amsterdam, parking space available and railway and metro station nearby.
What do we expect from you?
A conceptual view of software development in Java
A hands-on mentality
A customer-oriented approach
Team spirit
The ability to deal with deadlines
You expect every professional to create elegant, clean and readable code.
You consider senior expertise an ongoing quest to new techniques, frameworks, versions
A good balance in research and development
Experience with various frameworks, Preferable Spring or JEE
Experience with Maven and GIT
Knowledge Persistence with Java, preferably JPA2 and or Hibernate
Knowledge of databases, SQL and performance, preferably PostgreSQL
A good command of Dutch and English

We pioneer our own trading strategies and systems using clean code and sophisticated technology, running a global network with thousands of high-performance low-latency applications that solve problems in nanoseconds.

Our Technical Operations team forms a key unit as the coordination and control team of our Tech department. They are responsible for driving structural improvement to technology services across the business. As technical engineers they aren't afraid to get our hands dirty, but are mindful not to get lost in details either.

As a Business Systems Analyst, you will be part of a team that coordinates tech-wide projects, such as firm-wide implementation of new compliance requirements, the technical integration of satellite offices in our infrastructure or adjustment of our trading set-up to new exchange protocols. You'll work closely with developers and the infrastructure team in these projects.

TechOps also keeps a close eye on the day-to-day execution of our technology processes such as incident and change management. You will help the team spot and implement improvements that work in an environment where change is the norm, perform regular checks and deep dives to identify areas of improvement, and confirm we're executing our controls properly.

What will you do:
In this position you will handle a broad suite of tasks across all facets of the business. You are the connecting point between our software developers, operational engineers, and control functions such as compliance and risk. Concretely, you will:

Work together with our trading, technology and control teams to help drive cross-team projects to completion
Work closely with the Tech department to continuously optimize our Tech processes through regular checks and deep dives
Coordinate technical information security projects, in which you come up with solutions that work in environments where change is the norm

What does a work week look like?

You discuss whether all work has been done, who's taking care of deployment, what risks we see, and how we should diligently verifying our set-up after the go-live date.
There's a Technology incident review meeting is this week. You go through the incident database and select incidents for discussion that had significant impact or otherwise contain interesting lessons. You send out the agenda, chair the meeting, and might chase up action items.
You work on your deep dive into our backup implementation. You discuss the topic with relevant engineers, write a summary and identify process and technical improvements. You look after their implementation too.
On your operational day, you monitor incidents in the production environment. Application engineers are responsible for logging and fixing those, but you might ask critical questions in the incident tickets. You create the daily Technology incident summary, and at the end of the day share it with all employees. You also look at incoming exchange announcements, and check whether we should kick off protocol migration projects based on that information.

What you need:
You need to be a pragmatic thinker with strong communication skills, which you can adapt when interacting with people from different departments. You use your computer science skill set and experience to understand how systems interact, and quickly spot architectural improvements and imminent risks. You have attention to detail but can also zoom out to see the bigger picture.

Today, you’re investigating whether it wouldn’t be more effective to work with one single tooling platform for the whole company. It’s a long-term project you’re working on and you collaborate closely with your Team Lead Johan and Vladimir on a workable solution.
After lunch, you and Vladimir dive into the ticketing system and help your colleagues as much as you can. We’re all working from home and although your colleagues are not noobs when it comes to tech, they do have their challenges. After you’re done, you have a quick chat with Johan professionalizing the IT systems within Zivver, especially a new VPN solution. Together with Johan, you devise, execute and lead this project and it’s time to define the first steps asap. How time flies, it’s almost the end of the day. Ok, ok, just one more ticket before you go and you’re done.

After lunch, you and Vladimir dive into the ticketing system and help your colleagues as much as you can. We’re all working from home and although your colleagues are not noobs when it comes to tech, they do have their challenges. After you’re done, you have a quick chat with Johan professionalizing the IT systems within Zivver, especially a new VPN solution. Together with Johan, you devise, execute and lead this project and it’s time to define the first steps asap. How time flies, it’s almost the end of the day. Ok, ok, just one more ticket before you go and you’re done.

Our mission is to enable professionals across the globe to be more effective in their work and enjoy more happiness in life. Did you know that 85% of your effectiveness at work is determined by soft skills? To deliver on our mission, we deliver high impact soft skill training. Our training platform provides professionals with the more modern tools to develop themselves: online where possible, offline or face-to-face where that has more impact.

We launched early 2018 and the success of our approach is demonstrated by our rapidly expanding client-base - ranging from the most innovative and fast-growing scale-ups, such as Bynder and Picnic, to global corporates such as ING, and L’Oreal.

We are now fully committed to rapid growth and international expansion, supported by a recent €5 mln Series A investment. This makes it the perfect time to step in. The new Full Stack Developer has the opportunity to work in a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment, where he/she plays a central role in achieving ambitious growth.

A word on diversity: at Lepaya, all we’re askin’ is a little respect! To us, it doesn’t matter where you were born, what you believe in, how old you are, what you look like, or who you love.

Our passion is to build a strong culture with respect for each other’s unique experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Join us, as there is a place for you here!

At the moment, we are all about standardization and automation to make the work day of our Delivery Specialists much easier - they will highly appreciate it!

You will make the impossible possible by answering to the requests of your (less tech-savvy) colleagues and by contributing with new ideas on how to push our tech product to the next level with the right technologies. In collaboration with a cross-functional team you will work on perfect solutions for our product.

Specifically, what would we expect you to deliver over the next 6-12 months?
Build and improve our product from frontend to backend;
Improve existing and develop new features;
Problem-solving through the integration of various tools and system;

In an ideal world, who would you be?
You are passionate about technology and about solving related problems;
You know your tools and you can choose the right tool for the right job;
You have experience in building and maintaining web applications;
You have experience with Javascript/Typescript, Node.JS and VueJS;
You have experience with databases (Postgresql is a plus);

We value capabilities over formal experience, yet what would we love to see on your resume?

3+ years experience in software development;
Experience working with production environments;

And of course, next to the challenge we offer, why is it amazing to work for Lepaya?

You will join an inspiring and dynamic environment;
You will participate in Lepaya’s own training curriculum;
We offer accelerated personal growth and career opportunities;
We offer an attractive compensation package;

Our mission is to enable professionals across the globe to be more effective in their work and enjoy more happiness in life. Did you know that 85% of your effectiveness at work is determined by soft skills? To deliver on our mission, we deliver high impact soft skill training. Our training platform provides professionals with the more modern tools to develop themselves: online where possible, offline or face-to-face where that has more impact.

We launched early 2018 and the success of our approach is demonstrated by our rapidly expanding client-base - ranging from the most innovative and fast-growing scale-ups, such as Bynder and Picnic, to global corporates such as ING, and L’Oreal.

We are now fully committed to rapid growth and international expansion, supported by a recent €5 mln Series A investment. This makes it the perfect time to step in. The new Full Stack Developer has the opportunity to work in a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment, where he/she plays a central role in achieving ambitious growth.

A word on diversity: at Lepaya, all we’re askin’ is a little respect! To us, it doesn’t matter where you were born, what you believe in, how old you are, what you look like, or who you love. We believe that different perspectives and backgrounds will actually lift Lepaya to new heights and increase our power of thinking. Our passion is to build a strong culture with respect for each other’s unique experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Join us, as there is a place for you here!

You will make the impossible possible by answering to the requests of your (less tech-savvy) colleagues and by contributing with new ideas on how to push our tech product to the next level with the right technologies. In collaboration with a cross-functional team you will work on perfect solutions for our product.

Specifically, what would we expect you to deliver over the next 6-12 months?
Build and improve our product from frontend to backend;
Improve existing and develop new features;
Problem-solving through the integration of various tools and system;

In an ideal world, who would you be?
You are passionate about technology and about solving related problems;
You know your tools and you can choose the right tool for the right job;
You have experience in building and maintaining web applications;
You have experience with Javascript/Typescript, Node.JS and VueJS;
You have experience with databases (Postgresql is a plus);

We value capabilities over formal experience, yet what would we love to see on your resume?

3+ years experience in software development;
Experience working with production environments;

And of course, next to the challenge we offer, why is it amazing to work for Lepaya?

You will join an inspiring and dynamic environment;
You will participate in Lepaya’s own training curriculum;
We offer accelerated personal growth and career opportunities;
We offer an attractive compensation package;
And the best: participation in the Lepaya Work-To-Live schedule consisting of unlimited holidays & a free Friday every second week.

Our mission is to enable professionals across the globe to be more effective in their work and enjoy more happiness in life. Did you know that 85% of your effectiveness at work is determined by soft skills? To deliver on our mission, we deliver high impact soft skill training. Our training platform provides professionals with the more modern tools to develop themselves: online where possible, offline or face-to-face where that has more impact.

We launched early 2018 and the success of our approach is demonstrated by our rapidly expanding client-base - ranging from the most innovative and fast-growing scale-ups, such as Bynder and Picnic, to global corporates such as ING, and L’Oreal.

We are now fully committed to rapid growth and international expansion, supported by a recent €5 mln Series A investment. This makes it the perfect time to step in. The new Full Stack Developer has the opportunity to work in a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment, where he/she plays a central role in achieving ambitious growth.

A word on diversity: at Lepaya, all we’re askin’ is a little respect! To us, it doesn’t matter where you were born, what you believe in, how old you are, what you look like, or who you love. We believe that different perspectives and backgrounds will actually lift Lepaya to new heights and increase our power of thinking. Our passion is to build a strong culture with respect for each other’s unique experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Join us, as there is a place for you here!
