Amsterdam with a strong interdisciplinary component such as the Bachelor Future Planet Studies and the Master Earth Science To strengthen the links between research and teaching, and in particular the underpinning of interdisciplinary teaching with interdisciplinary research, IBED is seeking to recruit an interdisciplinary tenure track assistant professor on the topic of Sustainability within the FoodWaterEnergy FWE nexusAs humanity we find ourselves in a situation where a growing world population aspires to fulfil infinite ambitions on a finite planet This is captured by the Planetary Boundaries concept that identifies several interlinked planetary systems where it postulates a safe operating space within which sustainable development is possible Meeting Social Floors as required by human rights law and the Sustainable Development Goals may in itself lead to crossing planetary boundaries if technological and redistribution options are not adequately explored Our food, water and energy systems are closely interlinked and directly coupled to multiple planetary boundaries and the Social Floors The need for sustainable development within the FWE nexus is globally recognized However, the necessity to steer clear of the planetary boundaries poses an enormous challenge to make such development truly sustainable and socially justThe dynamics of ecosystems and human systems each have their own challenges in the context of sustainability in the FWE nexus, but the interaction of both systems is especially of relevance From an earth scientific  ecological perspective we need to understand biogeochemical cycles in soil and water, and quantify the effects of landuse change thereon From a governance perspective, we need to understand what social, economic, ecological, institutional and other drivers shape behavioural patterns and what kinds of policy mixes can best address these drivers at multiple levels of governanceYou will perform cuttingedge interdisciplinary research at the interface of ecosystems and human systems focusing on the challenging road towards sustainability within the food, water and energy systems Based on the background of the candidate, the emphasis may lie on one of the three systems or, preferably, combine them The work ideally combines field and laboratory work with theoretical analysis and modelling using systems thinking andor complexity science approachesThe described interdisciplinary research will form the foundation of an extensive researchbased interdisciplinary teaching portfolio within the Bachelor Future Planet

will only increase in future missions to the Moon and Mars Data for the study of this problem astronaut journals, mission logs, etc is however thin and difficult to obtain 1 Polar expeditions and bases offer a good analog for astronaut social psychology due to commonalities such as shared isolation, long duration and dangerous environments 2 Furthermore, data from these expeditions is more populous and easily availableIn this project, we thus aim to parse through journals, logs and similar data from past polar exploration in order to extract observations useful to the study of the social psychology of future human spaceflight We will do this by using Behavioural Sequence Analysis BSA, a method previously applied to the study of complex social processes 34 In BSA, behaviors observed in the data are first categorized manually, then analyzed statistically to find transitions between them that are occurring significantly above the level of chance In this way eg the sequences of interactions that lead to problematic outcomes, and the responsible combination of personal interactions and operational procedures can be investigated for a given scenario, for example a team breakdown in an Antarctic base while overwintering A collection of such results will help with the further study of the social psychology of human spaceflight and with the design of such

gradient information is not available One drawback of these methods, in most settings, is their slow convergence on high dimensional problems, such as those often encountered for example in trajectory design or remote sensing tasks Potential tradeoffs in objectives and constraints, as they are encountered in mission design thermal and radiation protection, energy consumption, size, mass, etc further exacerbate the search for good local optima Multilevel evolutionary algorithms mitigate this by performing evolution on several degrees of coarseness, but require manual definition of the different representations In multilevel graph partitioning, representations of the different levels are found automatically by considering the connectedness of their elements 1The objective of this internship is to understand whether a multilevel graph partitioning approach can be used to speed up evolutionary algorithms in the aerospace engineering domain by keeping highly correlated parameters fixed relative to each other and thus decreasing the effective dimensionality of the problem The method would be used to find an initial solution to be refined by recovering the original representation for a subsequent local optimization1 Sanders, Peter, and Christian Schulz KaHIPKarlsruhe High Quality Partitioning 2019Self MotivationCommunicationContinuous LearningCrossCultural
