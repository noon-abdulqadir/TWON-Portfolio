Netherlands","['Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Hospital & Health Care']",Education,"Job Description, , We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD student to contribute to our recently funded research within the Applied Epigenomics group of the Department of Genetic Identification at Erasmus MC, led by Dr Athina Vidaki The successful applicant will work on a project aiming at developing a novel and innovative epigenomic method that will assist the translation of epigenomic findings to the clinic and court, , Human epigenomic research has yielded numerous biomarkers predictive of personalized health and diseaserelated outcomes, such as in cancer diagnosis and management These personalized signatures can also be useful for specialized nonmedical applications, such as in forensics Over the years, epigenetic biomarker discovery has become possible via DNA methylation microarrays for epigenomewide screening of hundreds of thousands of biomarkers CpG sites, provided that the analysed DNA is of sufficiently high quantity and quality, which in many clinical and forensic applications it is not Therefore, clinical and forensic epigenomic applications have suffered thus far from smallscale targeted tests no more than 2030 CpG fragments, despite the need of many more CpGs to address these questions Currently, translation in epigenomic applications has come to a halt due to the lack of suitable largescale targeted methods, in terms of sensitivity, multiplex capability, flexibility, and costs, , In this project, we aim to tackle this major and timely technical limitation by developing and thoroughly testing a new method for the simultaneous targeted analysis of hundreds to thousands of CpGs, preselected for different applications We aim to achieve this via novel technological innovation that will allow for tailored and largescale targeted epigenomic testing from just 1001,000 cells, typically obtained in clinical settings that use liquid and need biopsies, but also in forensics that deal with trace evidence from crime scenes The project will include method development, thorough validation and direct application to selected clinical and

Technology, Engineering  Quality, , , , , , You will conduct research in the area of ModelBased Systems Engineering MBSE, , Modelbased engineering is an approach to the development of systems characterised by the use of models, eg visual modelling artefacts that serve as archetypes of the system under development, but mainly data digitisation enabling tool support for transformation or verification, to improve the efficiency and productivity of the system development life cycle MBSE is the particular use of the set of aspects of modelbased engineering specifically associated with systems engineering applied in a formal way to support life cycle activities by providing the reference for engineering data, , Modelbased systems engineering MBSE is the formalized application of modelling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases, INCOSE SE Vision 2020 INCOSETP200400402, Sep 2007, MBSE is the enabling set of technologies ie methods, tools, languages that allows us to author product artefacts to ensure digital continuity all along the life cycle, across disciplines and throughout the supply chain Produced artefacts enable proper elicitation of relationships between systems entities and between system project entities, , System complexity is at the root of our needs Initially manageable singly or by a small team of systems engineers, some of our space system complexity is starting to exceed what can be fully handled by a human team ESA has identified the following systems engineer needs formal representations beyond textual descriptions, controlled exchange of data supported by automated mechanisms, structured knowledge of their system, an authoritative source of truth consistent by construction from which appropriate viewpoints may be extracted to communicate about the system, dashboards with systems engineering information, to create consistent system baselines, to be able to initialise a system with a reusable set of consistent data, to grasp all relationships between all system entities, , The solution proposed to fulfill these needs relies on i semantic interoperability of tools based on the definition of a global conceptual data model ontology and ii definition of the reference architecture of a system factory, ie the software infrastructure supporting systems engineering, , , , , , Having this solution available at industry and Agency level would enable MBSE deployment in space projects You as Research Fellow will investigate MBSE and its space applications, propose and experimentimplement solutions to the theoretical and practical issues raised by deployment, , , ,
