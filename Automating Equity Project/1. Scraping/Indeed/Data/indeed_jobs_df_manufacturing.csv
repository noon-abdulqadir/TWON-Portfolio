Our teams work every day to make the impossible possible, to change the game, to be agile and effective, and most of all â€“ to empower the rest of the world to do the same.

We at Bitfury ensure our team members possess the ability to think out of the box and make the impossible possible. We are self-motivated and result-oriented, and we have an ""owner of the company"" mindset. We are constantly self-educating and developing. We are able to work in a team and collaborate. We have a ""do good"" mindset and are not afraid to dream big. And of course, we always deliver in time what we promised and with extreme attention to detail â€” because if we are not able to do the little things right, we will never be able to do big things right.

We are a diversified organisation, with operations across multiple facets of the AI, blockchain, and digital currency sectors. If you are passionate about emerging technologies, you can build your future at Bitfury.

Accelerate Your Career

Bitfury is growing fast and looking for the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs to help us. At Bitfury, you will be expected to create the future â€“ not just execute it. If you are a self-starter, driven and collaborative team member, you can create a dynamic future for yourself and your career at Bitfury.

Modern Workplace with Intelligent Flexibility

Bitfury lets you work in the way you need to work to make your work faster, smarter and better. We will give you the resources you need to succeed â€“ competitive pay and benefits, educational support, intellectual challenges, professional advancement, personal accommodations including remote work, and more. We pride ourselves on being less bureaucratic and a lot more impactful.

Start-up Culture with Established Results

Working with the world's leading experts and engineers, you will have the opportunity at Bitfury to pursue results that will power your success as well as lead to the adoption of game-changing technologies. Our teams work every day to make the impossible possible, to change the game, to be agile and effective, and most of all â€“ to empower the rest of the world to do the same.

Personal and Professional Characteristics

We at Bitfury ensure our team members possess the ability to think out of the box and make the impossible possible. We are self-motivated and result-oriented, and we have an ""owner of the company"" mindset. We are constantly self-educating and developing. We are able to work in a team and collaborate. We have a ""do good"" mindset and are not afraid to dream big. And of course, we always deliver in time what we promised and with extreme attention to detail â€” because if we are not able to do the little things right, we will never be able to do big things right.

WHO ARE WE?

We are on a mission to save the world from useless paper instructions. Imagine having to rely upon outdated work instructions that you misplaced whilst working on a busy production line. We realize that PDF and paper instructions are a thing of the past, so we're developing simple, intuitive cloud software to empower factory teams to perform better in their jobs and scale knowledge with digital standard work. Our Swipeguide platform enables global companies like Coca-Cola, Heineken, and PepsiCo to build and share visual step-by-step work instructions with their workforce on any device. We all know that a digital future is unavoidable, and we're providing the software essential for an effective digital transformation. And it's working. We started with five people in 2016, and today, we have twenty-five full-time employees, 100,000+ platform users in 89 countries worldwide, and an inclusive culture that we are always improving.

OUR TEAM OF SWIPEES

We have recently become a part-remote organization, but our office is safe for a small number of people to attend each day (totally optional). For the future, it's totally up to you: hammock on the beach or face-to-face smiles?
We work in a bustling startup hub called B.2 in Amsterdam with 300+ other startups. You'll see the usual ping pong table, foosball, arcade machines and PS4s everywhere. But, there are also lovely places to sit in the sun, break-out areas and ambitious people as far as the eye can see.
You'll soon meet the road cyclist, the yoga lover, the guy with an oyster business, the ex-chef, the person to count on in an emergency, the social butterfly, the basketball player, the green hair dyer and someone who owns hundreds of sneakers.
We like to fail (it's how we learn), and every Thursday in our PowWow, we share our failures and learn together.
Our values are at the heart of everything we do; we strive to enable Swipees to develop their potential and showcase their authentic selves and engage in a culture of inclusion.

WHO ARE WE?

We are on a mission to save the world from useless paper instructions. Imagine having to rely upon outdated work instructions that you misplaced whilst working on a busy production line. We realize that PDF and paper instructions are a thing of the past, so we're developing simple, intuitive cloud software to empower factory teams to perform better in their jobs and scale knowledge with digital standard work. Our Swipeguide platform enables global companies like Coca-Cola, Heineken, and PepsiCo to build and share visual step-by-step work instructions with their workforce on any device. We all know that a digital future is unavoidable, and we're providing the software essential for an effective digital transformation. And it's working. We started with five people in 2016, and today, we have twenty-five full-time employees, 100,000+ platform users in 89 countries worldwide, and an inclusive culture that we are always improving.

OUR TEAM OF SWIPEES

We have recently become a part-remote organization, but our office is safe for a small number of people to attend each day (totally optional). For the future, it's totally up to you: hammock on the beach or face-to-face smiles?
We work in a bustling startup hub called B.2 in Amsterdam with 300+ other startups. You'll see the usual ping pong table, foosball, arcade machines and PS4s everywhere. But, there are also lovely places to sit in the sun, break-out areas and ambitious people as far as the eye can see.
You'll soon meet the road cyclist, the yoga lover, the guy with an oyster business, the ex-chef, the person to count on in an emergency, the social butterfly, the basketball player, the green hair dyer and someone who owns hundreds of sneakers.
We like to fail (it's how we learn), and every Thursday in our PowWow, we share our failures and learn together.
Our values are at the heart of everything we do; we strive to enable Swipees to develop their potential and showcase their authentic selves and engage in a culture of inclusion.

SwipeGuide is committed to creating a diverse environment influenced by a lifetime of individual experiences.

WHO ARE WE?

We are on a mission to save the world from useless paper instructions. Imagine having to rely upon outdated work instructions that you misplaced whilst working on a busy production line. We realize that PDF and paper instructions are a thing of the past, so we're developing simple, intuitive cloud software to empower factory teams to perform better in their jobs and scale knowledge with digital standard work. Our Swipeguide platform enables global companies like Coca-Cola, Heineken, and PepsiCo to build and share visual step-by-step work instructions with their workforce on any device. We all know that a digital future is unavoidable, and we're providing the software essential for an effective digital transformation. And it's working. We started with five people in 2016, and today, we have twenty-five full-time employees, 100,000+ platform users in 89 countries worldwide, and an inclusive culture that we are always improving.

OUR TEAM OF SWIPEES

We have recently become a part-remote organization, but our office is safe for a small number of people to attend each day (totally optional). For the future, it's totally up to you: hammock on the beach or face-to-face smiles?
We work in a bustling startup hub called B.2 in Amsterdam with 300+ other startups. You'll see the usual ping pong table, foosball, arcade machines and PS4s everywhere. But, there are also lovely places to sit in the sun, break-out areas and ambitious people as far as the eye can see.
You'll soon meet the road cyclist, the yoga lover, the guy with an oyster business, the ex-chef, the person to count on in an emergency, the social butterfly, the basketball player, the green hair dyer and someone who owns hundreds of sneakers.
We like to fail (it's how we learn), and every Thursday in our PowWow, we share our failures and learn together.
Our values are at the heart of everything we do; we strive to enable Swipees to develop their potential and showcase their authentic selves and engage in a culture of inclusion.

YOUR ROLE AS THE PRODUCT MARKETER
