This chair is embedded in the ‘governance’ segment of the TILT research program and will contribute to both comparative and normative analysis of data governance models and practices worldwide. Work on governance is central to TILT’ research as it involves the study of both the structural conditions under which regulation and normative notions can have effect. As importantly, it interrogates the political and societal architectures which generate and shape normative notions about technology and which affect the conceptualization and operationalization of regulation. Research on data governance touches on law, social science, economics, and Science & Technology Studies. It focuses on the landscape of data technologies including how these technologies are produced (including the fields of research, innovation and market creation); used (including applications such as AI and machine learning, data analytics and data science) and regulated (by law, economic and social policy, and design). The normative component of this research agenda involves understanding how fundamental values become translated (or not) into rights and norms in different regions, the extent to which those differing perspectives can be reconciled on a fundamental level, and how that reconciliation might be done in terms of law, politics and practice.The study of governance necessitates an interdisciplinary set of approaches ranging from political economy and public administration to sociological and philosophical theory. It focuses on the interaction of power, politics and normative frameworks in issues such as regulation, institution-building and enforcement. The study of technology governance in particular has a strong multidisciplinary character and plays a role in linking and underpinning the different pillars of LTMS’s research agenda (which currently center on innovation and competition, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, accountability and liability, and cybersecurity).The governance of data technologies necessitates a research scope that goes beyond the EU/US axis and that is inclusive of, but not limited to, legal and regulatory concerns. This scope incorporates an understanding of the global landscape of technology development and regulation, given that the production and trading of data occurs across borders and jurisdictions. From this perspective, the study of data governance involves the ways in which different (geo)political and economic contexts shape the aims, institutions and processes of law and regulation. Relevant concerns to this research chair include responsibility and accountability with respect to the design and operation of data technologies; the intersection of rights-based visions of data governance with the political economy of technological innovation, and framings of justice with regard to governing data technologies. Bodies of theory relevant to this position include, but are not limited to, the domains of Science and Technology Studies (STS), law, public administration, ethics and both political and legal philosophy.This position involves bridging between technical and social scientific perspectives and communities, as well as understanding the global landscape of data technology and its regulation. Translation takes place partly on the level of TILT and Tilburg University through conducting interdisciplinary research, field-building and teaching, but is also essential for societal and policy engagement on issues of data governance.Job description: Tasks1.

For more information, see the website of Humanities.The project Exploiting the Empire of Others can be summarized as follows. Early Modern European empires are portrayed and perceived as nationally geared enterprises, as entangled spaces at the peripheries and as zones of contact. In the Netherlands, these perceptions have filtered into the public debate that seeks to define material and immaterial responsibilities for the colonial past. What the historiographical perceptions, academic portrayals and public debate seem, however, to ignore is the role played by foreigners (being non-subjects of a specific king or republic) I exploiting the empires of other countries. This project will establish how and why Dutch entrepreneurs (being those taking risks in matters of trade or production, introducing innovations, making decisions based on information that others did not possess and searching for opportunities where most perceived risk) participated in exploiting the English, French and Iberian Empires, as Dutch firms are particularly prominent in the European colonial landscape. Since Dutch entrepreneurs engaged in exploiting the resources of other countries, what is the future of the public debate in the Netherlands, and Europe at large, regarding a shared responsibility for the colonial past?The answer(s) to these questions can be found in the multiple public and private archives that house extensive collections of the firms that operated from the Dutch Republic into the four largest empires in Western Europe. By combining original and recently uncovered archival sources pertaining to the relevant men (and some women), businesses and activities and their relationships with fellow traders, investors and political powers in situ, this project carries the seed to change commonly held perceptions regarding Dutch colonial participation and how these perceptions are often filtered into the public debate. This socio-economic entanglement of empires may have resulted in a shared European culture of exploitation that is impossible to disentangle within public debates that remain nationally bound. Within this overarching project, a 0.75 FTE, 36-months postdoc position is available.Dutch Entrepreneurial Exploitation of Cash Crops and Natural Resources (Including Tax Farming) in the Colonies of OthersIn this subproject, the successful applicant will be asked to conceptualize the investment of Dutch firms in the empire of others having as starting point three specific themes: cash crops (and associated allocation of labour), natural resources and tax farming. The analysis will be approached from the point of view of the firm and the mechanisms of management of complex portfolios that included, at times simultaneously, the exploitation of multiple sources of income and revenue.In terms of exploitation of revenue, and often through mechanisms of public debt, many Dutch firms became entangled in the political and expansionist projects of different monarchies. In this context, the postdoc will be invited to reflect upon the consequences of this entanglement for the development of specific and common features of the political economy of European empires and the pre-imperialist association between private capital and public administration of empire.Terms and conditionsThe postdoc position is part-time (0.75 FTE).

This is the vacancy announcement for postdoc 2. The appointment is in principle for a period of 18 months, starting September 1st 2021 by the latest, or sooner if possible. The postdoc will be working under supervision of the PI of the project, Dr Nadya Purtova, and embedded at the Department of the Law, Technology, Markets and Society, part of the Law School of Tilburg University.Note: the start date of the project is subject to EU approval, which will apply as soon as the human resources for the project are in place.Job descriptionThe projectThe project aims to reinvent the current system of legal protection against negative effects of the data- and information technology-driven harms. In Europe this system is currently embodied in the data protection law (such as the GDPR) and is centered around the notion of personal data: the assumption underlying this system of protection is that if collection and use of personal data are regulated, information-technology related harms will be averted. Yet, using the concept of personal data as a trigger is not without problems. The boundary between data that is personal and not personal is increasingly less clear. Modern data collection and processing techniques as well as the growing spread of their uses across societal contexts (e.g. reliance on data and AI in decision-making by public authorities, policing, marketing) lead to a situation where any information can be personal data. Anchoring legal protection against digital harms in the concept “personal data” is a legacy of legislative choices made in the past, and alternative ways of structuring legal protection are possible.Given a broad meaning of personal data, a growing range of situations and problems falls within the ambit of data protection law, which is not equipped to deal with them all equally well. Simply narrowing down the concept of personal data would not do (where should we (re)draw the line?). The problem requires fundamental rethinking of the current approach to legal protection.The project looks to suggest alternative avenues for legal protection which are not conditional on the concept of personal data. We are looking for alternative ideas, concepts, or principles that would allow to restructure legal protection.TasksThe postdoc will contribute to the project by the study of data economy, for example, business models, actors and their incentives, place of data and code in that economy, etc. He/she will conduct theoretical research from the perspective of his/her disciplinary background, including the insights of economics in his/her work. The theoretical work will be complemented by the empirical study of data economy in 3 contexts: online advertising, smart grid and smart cities. He/she will be offered a contract of 18 months.Prior to applying it is advisable that the candidates get familiar with Dr. Purtova’s work, including:N.

This is the vacancy announcement for postdoc 1. The appointment is in principle for a period of 18 months, starting September 1st 2021 by the latest, or sooner if possible. The postdocs will be working under supervision of the PI of the project, Dr. Nadya Purtova, and embedded at the Department of the Law, Technology, Markets and Society, part of the Law School of Tilburg University.Note: the start date of the project is subject to EU approval, which will apply as soon as the human resources for the project are in place.Job descriptionThe projectThe project aims to reinvent the current system of legal protection against negative effects of the data- and information technology-driven harms. In Europe this system is currently embodied in the data protection law (such as the GDPR) and is centered around the notion of personal data: the assumption underlying this system of protection is that if collection and use of personal data are regulated, information-technology related harms will be averted. Yet, using the concept of personal data as a trigger is not without problems. The boundary between data that is personal and not personal is increasingly less clear. Modern data collection and processing techniques as well as the growing spread of their uses across societal contexts (e.g. reliance on data and AI in decision-making by public authorities, policing, marketing) lead to a situation where any information can be personal data. Anchoring legal protection against digital harms in the concept “personal data” is a legacy of legislative choices made in the past, and alternative ways of structuring legal protection are possible.Given a broad meaning of personal data, a growing range of situations and problems falls within the ambit of data protection law, which is not equipped to deal with them all equally well. Simply narrowing down the concept of personal data would not do (where should we (re)draw the line?). The problem requires fundamental rethinking of the current approach to legal protection.The project looks to suggest alternative avenues for legal protection which are not conditional on the concept of personal data. We are looking for alternative ideas, concepts, or principles that would allow to restructure legal protection.TasksThe postdoc will contribute to the project by the study of data- and information technologies and practices. He/she will conduct theoretical research from the perspective of his/her discipline. The theoretical work will be complemented by the empirical study of data- and information technologies and practices in 3 contexts: online advertising, smart grid and smart cities. He/she will be offered a contract of 18 months.Prior to applying it is advisable that the candidates get familiar with Dr Purtova’s work, including:N.

However, people and organisations often resist such conducive change to face these challenges or perceive obstacles to alter their actual behaviors, routines and procedures.Technological innovations may help address such resistance. For example, technological means (e.g. sensor and eye tracking data, ecological momentary assessments) offer insights into inner states and processes within and between people (e.g. emotion and deception/sincerity detection), and, hence, help identify why and when resistance to conducive change is greatest. Second, technology can be used to set up and enrich interventions that tackle resistance to conducive change in ways that were previously impossible (e.g. VR simulations to train police officers to prevent ethnic profiling).The PCRS section seeks to address and overcome such change resistance using technology, and is therefore seeking to hire an Assistant Professor. Cornerstone of our section’s research and teaching is the role of individuals and groups in issues related to psychological, physical or societal safety. We take an interdisciplinary approach to understand and develop interventions to counter such threats, combining (social) psychological perspectives with communication sciences and public administration, and apply this to topics as conflict (e.g. polarization) and crisis management, risk perception and risk communication, crime prevention (e.g. cybercrime and undermining), restorative justice interventions, and sustainability. Technology plays a central role in our research and teaching – this is facilitated by our excellent BMSlab (including our state-of-the-art mobile lab facility).Additionally, we collaborate closely with partners from practice, such as National Crisis Centres, law enforcement agencies, energy consultants, ministries and Kenniscentrum Veilige Digitale Samenleving (Apeldoorn) and the Dutch Perspectief Herstelbemiddeling.We primarily teach in the educational bachelor and master programs of Psychology.

For example, technological means (e.g. sensor and eye tracking data, ecological momentary assessments) offer insights into inner states and processes within and between people (e.g. emotion and deception/sincerity detection), and, hence, help identify why and when resistance to conducive change is greatest. Second, technology can be used to set up and enrich interventions that tackle resistance to conducive change in ways that were previously impossible (e.g. VR simulations to train police officers to prevent ethnic profiling).The PCRS section seeks to address and overcome such change resistance using technology, and is therefore seeking to hire an Assistant Professor. Cornerstone of our section’s research and teaching is the role of individuals and groups in issues related to psychological, physical or societal safety. We take an interdisciplinary approach to understand and develop interventions to counter such threats, combining (social) psychological perspectives with communication sciences and public administration, and apply this to topics as conflict (e.g. polarization) and crisis management, risk perception and risk communication, crime prevention (e.g. cybercrime and undermining), restorative justice interventions, and sustainability. Technology plays a central role in our research and teaching – this is facilitated by our excellent BMSlab (including our state-of-the-art mobile lab facility).Additionally, we collaborate closely with partners from practice, such as National Crisis Centres, law enforcement agencies, energy consultants, ministries and Kenniscentrum Veilige Digitale Samenleving (Apeldoorn) and the Dutch Perspectief Herstelbemiddeling.We primarily teach in the educational bachelor and master programs of Psychology. We believe in a strong connection between research and teaching. The teaching/research ratio is 60/40 on average (depending on the success of attracting external funding).
You are in possession of a PhD and have a track record in social sciences (e.g. Psychology, Communication Sciences, Public Administration) preferably in relation to PCRS’ topics of interest described above (see also https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/pcrv/).You embrace the UT motto High Tech Human Touch and see(k) opportunities in working in a technical environment and with our exciting state-of-the-art BMSlab.You have a strong entrepreneurial and valorization orientation. You enjoy working in multidisciplinary teams as well as with partners from practice.You have a proven ability to attract external research funding.You have a passion for teaching and the ambition to constantly improve your teaching skills using new and engaging teaching methods.You have excellent communication skills. Your English is at least at the C1 level.You are in possession of a University Teaching Qualification (or similar), or are willing to earn one within three years.
You will be appointed for four years with the prospect of a permanent position. The university offers a dynamic ecosystem; internationalization is an important part of the strategic agenda.A dynamic, cooperative work environment with entrepreneurial and enthusiastic colleagues.A high degree of responsibility and independence.Professional and personal development programmes.Starting salary is between € 3.746 and € 5.826 gross per month based on your experience.A holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.A solid pension scheme.Possibilities to save up holidays for sabbatical leave.Minimum of 29 holiday days in case of full-time employment.We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

,public administration,Glassdoor,4045409359,Assistant Professor of Public Administration (0.6 - 1.0 FTE),,Tilburg University,Tilburg,Hogescholen en universiteiten,"Tilburg Law School is looking for a Professor in International Data Governance (1.0 FTE)Department : LTMS, home of TILT and TILECLocation : Tilburg, The NetherlandsScientific discipline : Science and Technology Studies (STS), law, public administration, ethics, political and legal philosophyFull time equivalent : 1.0 fte (40 hours per week)Duration of employment agreement : 5 yearsMonthly full time salary : € 5,749 - € 8,371 grossA new chair in International Data GovernanceAt TILT, we have a vacancy for a professor of international data governance. This chair is embedded in the ‘governance’ segment of the TILT research program and will contribute to both comparative and normative analysis of data governance models and practices worldwide. Work on governance is central to TILT’ research as it involves the study of both the structural conditions under which regulation and normative notions can have effect. As importantly, it interrogates the political and societal architectures which generate and shape normative notions about technology and which affect the conceptualization and operationalization of regulation. Research on data governance touches on law, social science, economics, and Science & Technology Studies. It focuses on the landscape of data technologies including how these technologies are produced (including the fields of research, innovation and market creation); used (including applications such as AI and machine learning, data analytics and data science) and regulated (by law, economic and social policy, and design). The normative component of this research agenda involves understanding how fundamental values become translated (or not) into rights and norms in different regions, the extent to which those differing perspectives can be reconciled on a fundamental level, and how that reconciliation might be done in terms of law, politics and practice.The study of governance necessitates an interdisciplinary set of approaches ranging from political economy and public administration to sociological and philosophical theory. It focuses on the interaction of power, politics and normative frameworks in issues such as regulation, institution-building and enforcement. The study of technology governance in particular has a strong multidisciplinary character and plays a role in linking and underpinning the different pillars of LTMS’s research agenda (which currently center on innovation and competition, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, accountability and liability, and cybersecurity).The governance of data technologies necessitates a research scope that goes beyond the EU/US axis and that is inclusive of, but not limited to, legal and regulatory concerns. This scope incorporates an understanding of the global landscape of technology development and regulation, given that the production and trading of data occurs across borders and jurisdictions. From this perspective, the study of data governance involves the ways in which different (geo)political and economic contexts shape the aims, institutions and processes of law and regulation. Relevant concerns to this research chair include responsibility and accountability with respect to the design and operation of data technologies; the intersection of rights-based visions of data governance with the political economy of technological innovation, and framings of justice with regard to governing data technologies. Bodies of theory relevant to this position include, but are not limited to, the domains of Science and Technology Studies (STS), law, public administration, ethics and both political and legal philosophy.This position involves bridging between technical and social scientific perspectives and communities, as well as understanding the global landscape of data technology and its regulation. Translation takes place partly on the level of TILT and Tilburg University through conducting interdisciplinary research, field-building and teaching, but is also essential for societal and policy engagement on issues of data governance.Job description: Tasks1.

For more information, see the website of Humanities.The project Exploiting the Empire of Others can be summarized as follows. Early Modern European empires are portrayed and perceived as nationally geared enterprises, as entangled spaces at the peripheries and as zones of contact. In the Netherlands, these perceptions have filtered into the public debate that seeks to define material and immaterial responsibilities for the colonial past. What the historiographical perceptions, academic portrayals and public debate seem, however, to ignore is the role played by foreigners (being non-subjects of a specific king or republic) I exploiting the empires of other countries. This project will establish how and why Dutch entrepreneurs (being those taking risks in matters of trade or production, introducing innovations, making decisions based on information that others did not possess and searching for opportunities where most perceived risk) participated in exploiting the English, French and Iberian Empires, as Dutch firms are particularly prominent in the European colonial landscape. Since Dutch entrepreneurs engaged in exploiting the resources of other countries, what is the future of the public debate in the Netherlands, and Europe at large, regarding a shared responsibility for the colonial past?The answer(s) to these questions can be found in the multiple public and private archives that house extensive collections of the firms that operated from the Dutch Republic into the four largest empires in Western Europe. By combining original and recently uncovered archival sources pertaining to the relevant men (and some women), businesses and activities and their relationships with fellow traders, investors and political powers in situ, this project carries the seed to change commonly held perceptions regarding Dutch colonial participation and how these perceptions are often filtered into the public debate. This socio-economic entanglement of empires may have resulted in a shared European culture of exploitation that is impossible to disentangle within public debates that remain nationally bound. Within this overarching project, a 0.75 FTE, 36-months postdoc position is available.Dutch Entrepreneurial Exploitation of Cash Crops and Natural Resources (Including Tax Farming) in the Colonies of OthersIn this subproject, the successful applicant will be asked to conceptualize the investment of Dutch firms in the empire of others having as starting point three specific themes: cash crops (and associated allocation of labour), natural resources and tax farming. The analysis will be approached from the point of view of the firm and the mechanisms of management of complex portfolios that included, at times simultaneously, the exploitation of multiple sources of income and revenue.In terms of exploitation of revenue, and often through mechanisms of public debt, many Dutch firms became entangled in the political and expansionist projects of different monarchies. In this context, the postdoc will be invited to reflect upon the consequences of this entanglement for the development of specific and common features of the political economy of European empires and the pre-imperialist association between private capital and public administration of empire.Terms and conditionsThe postdoc position is part-time (0.75 FTE).

This is the vacancy announcement for postdoc 2. The appointment is in principle for a period of 18 months, starting September 1st 2021 by the latest, or sooner if possible. The postdoc will be working under supervision of the PI of the project, Dr Nadya Purtova, and embedded at the Department of the Law, Technology, Markets and Society, part of the Law School of Tilburg University.Note: the start date of the project is subject to EU approval, which will apply as soon as the human resources for the project are in place.Job descriptionThe projectThe project aims to reinvent the current system of legal protection against negative effects of the data- and information technology-driven harms. In Europe this system is currently embodied in the data protection law (such as the GDPR) and is centered around the notion of personal data: the assumption underlying this system of protection is that if collection and use of personal data are regulated, information-technology related harms will be averted. Yet, using the concept of personal data as a trigger is not without problems. The boundary between data that is personal and not personal is increasingly less clear. Modern data collection and processing techniques as well as the growing spread of their uses across societal contexts (e.g. reliance on data and AI in decision-making by public authorities, policing, marketing) lead to a situation where any information can be personal data. Anchoring legal protection against digital harms in the concept “personal data” is a legacy of legislative choices made in the past, and alternative ways of structuring legal protection are possible.Given a broad meaning of personal data, a growing range of situations and problems falls within the ambit of data protection law, which is not equipped to deal with them all equally well. Simply narrowing down the concept of personal data would not do (where should we (re)draw the line?). The problem requires fundamental rethinking of the current approach to legal protection.The project looks to suggest alternative avenues for legal protection which are not conditional on the concept of personal data. We are looking for alternative ideas, concepts, or principles that would allow to restructure legal protection.TasksThe postdoc will contribute to the project by the study of data economy, for example, business models, actors and their incentives, place of data and code in that economy, etc. He/she will conduct theoretical research from the perspective of his/her disciplinary background, including the insights of economics in his/her work.

However, people and organisations often resist such conducive change to face these challenges or perceive obstacles to alter their actual behaviors, routines and procedures.Technological innovations may help address such resistance. For example, technological means (e.g. sensor and eye tracking data, ecological momentary assessments) offer insights into inner states and processes within and between people (e.g. emotion and deception/sincerity detection), and, hence, help identify why and when resistance to conducive change is greatest. Second, technology can be used to set up and enrich interventions that tackle resistance to conducive change in ways that were previously impossible (e.g. VR simulations to train police officers to prevent ethnic profiling).The PCRS section seeks to address and overcome such change resistance using technology, and is therefore seeking to hire an Assistant Professor. Cornerstone of our section’s research and teaching is the role of individuals and groups in issues related to psychological, physical or societal safety. We take an interdisciplinary approach to understand and develop interventions to counter such threats, combining (social) psychological perspectives with communication sciences and public administration, and apply this to topics as conflict (e.g. polarization) and crisis management, risk perception and risk communication, crime prevention (e.g. cybercrime and undermining), restorative justice interventions, and sustainability. Technology plays a central role in our research and teaching – this is facilitated by our excellent BMSlab (including our state-of-the-art mobile lab facility).Additionally, we collaborate closely with partners from practice, such as National Crisis Centres, law enforcement agencies, energy consultants, ministries and Kenniscentrum Veilige Digitale Samenleving (Apeldoorn) and the Dutch Perspectief Herstelbemiddeling.We primarily teach in the educational bachelor and master programs of Psychology.
