and business technologically savvy people working here from 15 nationalities and counting Were proud of the awards we have received, but the trust we get every day from our 2000 customers means more than anything, , We proud ourselves to be selected to be part of the elite 1 Microsoft Inner Circle out of the 64K global partners  ISVs, for 14 years consecutive years, incl 20202021, , , , Your gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, skin color or pink hair are part of who you are ToIncrease is an equal opportunity employer and we stand for equality and inclusion If youre a team player, an expert and are ready to shine, we would love to welcome you to the team, , , , We are in need of a Product Manager that has a solid background in building and maintaining Cloud Native Applications SaaS Once you are working for ToIncrease, you will become responsible for our journey towards Micro Services where we closely work crossteam to build new Cloud Native Applications SaaS to help innovate in domains and offerings, of Discrete and Process Manufacturing, Equipment Rental, Application, and Business Integrations, Enterprise Mobility, Business Productivity, and Business Intelligence and Analytics, , You will be able to set the future for these solutions by creating a vision for the solutions that contains a description of the future state, but also a roadmap on the transition to that state As you go you always keep in mind the bigger purpose of ToIncrease and the goals that are defined as well as the market changes and disruptions Our assetcentric solutions include engineering, manufacturing, servicing, and renting or leasing assets We also deliver customercentric solutions that help companies align technology with strategic goals, operate more efficiently, and provide the best possible experience to their customers, , Using the roadmap, you will translate the 3year roadmap to 1year goals and down to individual Epics that will be executed within a Program Increment, , The content of the Epics is clear to everyone, has been discussed with the team, has received consensus from the team and has been estimated towards time needed to develop You will then present these Epics for approval to our board and report back to the team to let them develop Once an Epic is ready, you will take ownership by signing off on it and together with our Marketing Leads you will work together to inform the world what we have done and the added value we deliver, , Of course, you will also be in contact with partners, customers and potentially other stakeholders, as they are part of your source With ease and confidence, you should be able to take the stage and present our offering, process and results, , , , We have several solutions on Finance  Supply Chain Management as well as on Business Central We have requests from partners, customer but also from Microsoft directly to add functionality fill white spaces to our existing solutions, but we also have the important move towards Micro services, , Combine these subjects and you see that we need to change the way we look at our solutions from an ERPsolution to a solution that fills a gap or relieves a customer pain, regardless of platform or device Our product portfolio is about to change and shift towards Micro services meaning that we have quite the journey ahead of us to create smaller cloud native applications instead of full ERP offerings, , Our solutions are mature, but maturity can lead to complacency and we cannot afford that We need to keep innovating, both functional and technical Here also the importance of Customer Experience is growing which we need to closely follow, identify and act upon to make our solutions the best of the best in terms of customer experience, , , , You start by exploring our solutions and the visions that we have created for our domains Based on that you can closely connect to the teams to help them move towards Micro Services Your experience is going vital to the success of each domain as you are a crossdomain player in the product management community Important is that we always keep a close eye to the business value we want to deliver to our customers During that period, you will be immersed in the Program Increment process of creating Epics, estimating them, defending them to the Portfolio Management
