inventions, a rich genre providing a social biography for the accoutrements of human life Writing, seafaring, building houses, making sacrifice to the gods there is a great concern with establishing

instance of language and speech There are also a few instances of women inventors Stories of the help to structure and anchor the past of a group Today we can still identify modern myths of invention, featuring for instance stereotypical inventors, lone wolves and geniuses, and epics of endurance, sudden insights and serendipity Modern narratives of invention thus also have a recognizable discourse of their own, , A particularly fruitful anchoring topos is to use the inspiration of   This is particularly obvious in stories of technological inventions, as when the bones of a fish inspire the

the viability of a system of tradable visitation permits for Antarctica, by reviewing the academic and political debates on restricting Antarctic tourist volumes making a systematic assessment of the available options for the choices concerning the cap, initial allocation, allocation to endusers and trade and simulating a range of possible systems of tradable visitation permits in order to test

the process of diversification of Antarctic tourism, study how this diversification relates to the fundamental values en principles of the ATS and, examine instruments of proactive management One of the objectives is to provide knowledge for the CEP process towards the development of a framework for conducting preassessments relating to novel tourism and other nongovernmental activities that raise particular concerns These would be derived from an exploration of the socioeconomic drivers of tourism diversification and its desirability, as well as the ability to find legal tools to

inventions that affect social life cannot thrive unless they are somehow embedded in the society for which they are intended Innovation will always be connected somehowboth in the ways it is communicated and perceived, and in terms of contentto what people know, believe, want, value, and can understand This is true even of radical, pathbreaking, revolutionary ideas and insights This phenomenon of anchoring is central to the new research agenda of the Dutch classicists, , In Classical Antiquity, one way in which this anchoring is realized is through narratives of inventors and inventions, a rich genre providing a social biography for the accoutrements of human life Writing, seafaring, building houses, making sacrifice to the gods there is a great concern with establishing the pedigree of these phenomena, which are often associated with specific culture heroes, gods, and other inventors, who act as Agents of Change Sometimes we find ideas about collective invention, for instance of language and speech There are also a few instances of women inventors Stories of the help to structure and anchor the past of a group Today we can still identify modern myths of invention, featuring for instance stereotypical inventors, lone wolves and geniuses, and epics of endurance, sudden insights and serendipity Modern narratives of invention thus also have a recognizable discourse of their own, , A particularly fruitful anchoring topos is to use the inspiration of   This is particularly obvious in stories of technological inventions, as when the bones of a fish inspire the invention of the comb On the other hand, human technology and cultural advances can also be perceived as a threat to the natural order humankind trespasses on the domain of the gods, and hubristically exceeds its natural limits, , This nexus of ideas deserves indepth exploration in the context of our Anchoring Innovation program We invite structured PhD proposals with ideas on the discourse,
