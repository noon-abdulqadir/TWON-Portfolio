Management', 'Research', 'Government Administration']","Final Project EvaluationTerms of ReferenceAuthorDocument Number1MTBORevisionReview byV120102020MTBOTS, MB, RL, VYSMThese are the Terms of Reference for the final project evaluation of the Uganda Justice Innovation Programme with grantID 51180135HiiL has been active in Uganda since 2015 In addition to our headquarters in The Hague with 39 international staff, we have a local office in Kampala with three local staff members in October 2020In partnership with the Swedish Embassy in Uganda, HiiL has been running the Uganda Justice Innovation Programme since 2017 and activities will end on 31 December 2020 The programme was designed to ensure that more people in Uganda, in particular the most vulnerable, are empowered to resolve their most pressing justice problems more fairly and effectively Together with our partners, we work to increase capacity of the justice system and make it more open, inclusive and innovative The programme followed on from a Justice Needs and Satisfaction survey that was conducted in 2015 and aimed to address some of those justice needsProgramme RationaleAt the time of development the rationale behind the programme is summarised below Lessons have been learnt along the way and some of that rationale will have changed and will need to be incorporated into the evaluationBetter justice delivery is organised through collecting and sharing data from the experiences of the users of the justice system This data creates more awareness of the most pressing justice needs, the quality and costs of access to justice amongst the users of justice, civil society organisations, publicly funded justice delivery organisations, academia, the different arms of government, and donors, on the basis of which they can advocate, prioritize, and work to improve services and procedures through evidencebased learning Additionally by capturing best practices on what works on family justice issues, this can be used by practitioners to improve on the delivery of justiceEach country has social entrepreneurs Entrepreneurship is an enabler, a driver and an empowering tool for sustainable development The power of entrepreneurship can also be harnessed to increase access to justice The most promising justice entrepreneurs are selected to address problems identified in the justice needs survey and accelerated to increase their impact, based on sustainable funding models and using business acceleration methods This will increase access to justice that is locally owned, embedded, and sustainably fundedFinally traditional rule of law building activities, such as building capacity and infrastructure, do not suffice Innovative approaches that start from citizens needs and take the political dimension of rule of law building into account are essential This requires supporting agents of sustainable change at all levels, including justice reformers at the highest political level who experience strong resistance and challenges in improving the justice system Through providing peer support and advice to justice leaders at the highest political level, they develop stronger leadership knowledge, skills, attitudes, personalities and networks, which positions them to innovate, develop and maintain effective justice systemsThe majority of the programme has taken place in Kampala, though a part of the work has taken place in other areas Arua, Mbarara, Soroti, Kibaale district as well The original logframe is attachedProgramme ObjectivesThe main
