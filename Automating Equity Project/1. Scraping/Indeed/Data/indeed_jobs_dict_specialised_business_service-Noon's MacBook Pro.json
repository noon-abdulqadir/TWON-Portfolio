You show a strong passion for digital product design and have a number of beautiful projects supported by a strong process to show for it. Being curious and thoughtful, you are focussed on quality. You have an eye for improvement and won\u2019t shy away from fruitful discussion.

You love a challenge and get excited when you move projects towards practical realisation.\n\nCollaborating closely with our clients, you are in a position to build thriving relationships. Your excellent communication skills guide them throughout the design process and facilitate decision making, keeping their best interest in mind.\n\nExpectations:\n\nYou have a passion for UX (duh) and are familiar with tools like Sketch, Figma, Principle & ProtoPie.\nYou love testing your ideas with the people for whom you design them for, you believe the cornerstone to a design process is a strong research foundation.\nBecause you know a good product can only be realised when the people are a team and the process is clear.

Your independence in your roles and projects grows with the experience and expertise you get. You will start out assisting other designers on a project, learning about design patterns, creating wireframes, communicating your designs to stakeholders, scrum, etc. This helps you build a strong foundation of design skills.\n\nIf you already have some experience\nAs you grow, you run more projects and discover multiple parts of the design process like research and facilitation. Slowly taking on more responsibilities in projects. You will grow into the role that fits you like a glove, which can be a deep dive in specialised topics like UX research, UX design, animation or more broadly like facilitation and design ops related roles. You might even start to pick up some internal roles to share knowledge or help organising weekendjes weg.\n\nIf you are an experienced designer\nIf you've already gained a lot of experience we might consider you for the roles where you have autonomy and the responsibility for the overall quality of our projects.

You show a strong passion for digital product design and have a number of beautiful projects supported by a strong process to show for it. Being curious and thoughtful, you are focussed on quality. You have an eye for improvement and won\u2019t shy away from fruitful discussion.

Your independence in your roles and projects grows with the experience and expertise you get. You will start out assisting other designers on a project, learning about design patterns, creating wireframes, communicating your designs to stakeholders, scrum, etc. This helps you build a strong foundation of design skills.\n\nIf you already have some experience\nAs you grow, you run more projects and discover multiple parts of the design process like research and facilitation. Slowly taking on more responsibilities in projects. You will grow into the role that fits you like a glove, which can be a deep dive in specialised topics like UX research, UX design, animation or more broadly like facilitation and design ops related roles. You might even start to pick up some internal roles to share knowledge or help organising weekendjes weg.\n\nIf you are an experienced designer\nIf you've already gained a lot of experience we might consider you for the roles where you have autonomy and the responsibility for the overall quality of our projects. You fill roles where you are the lead designer, shaping the design proces at our clients, or defining and improving the standard we have for UX design or other design related topics.

You show a strong passion for digital product design and have a number of beautiful projects supported by a strong process to show for it. Being curious and thoughtful, you are focussed on quality. You have an eye for improvement and won\u2019t shy away from fruitful discussion. You find yourself most energised when you combine your expertise and your knack for guidance to explore a range of design solutions. You love a challenge and get excited when you move projects towards practical realisation.\n\nCollaborating closely with our clients, you are in a position to build thriving relationships. Your excellent communication skills guide them throughout the design process and facilitate decision making, keeping their best interest in mind.\n\nExpectations:\n\nYou have a passion for UX (duh) and are familiar with tools like Sketch, Figma, Principle & ProtoPie.\nYou love testing your ideas with the people for whom you design them for, you believe the cornerstone to a design process is a strong research foundation.\nBecause you know a good product can only be realised when the people are a team and the process is clear. Therefor you stay up to date with all project frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, etc.\nYou see yourself designing for a variety of contexts, from car selling platforms to multi\u2014media service providers, learning about the world of the people using these products before the project has even started.\nYou are constantly learning and staying up to date on the latest UX trends.\nIf anything sparks joy for you, it is finding a good balance between user needs, business requirements and technological possibilities in close collaboration with our clients.\nYou are not shy in asking questions and voice your opinion to clients and colleagues about the requirements for a user story, or a design that has been created.\nYou crave feedback from peers and clients because you are always looking to improve the way you work.\nTrying out new techniques and improving your workflow is something you do naturally.\nYou want to be a part of our Amsterdam team (and are able to work from there when corona is over)*\nYou can speak and\/or understand Dutch and English\n\nPlease note we are looking for people living in the Netherlands, able to travel to our clients and work from our Amsterdam office.\nAbout your job\n\nAs a U\/Interaction Designer you create and deliver high quality design for clients.

You collaborate with others, either within Hike One or as a member of a client\u2019s team.\n\nIf this is your first job\nAs a designer that is just starting out, you will work together with colleagues a lot. Your independence in your roles and projects grows with the experience and expertise you get. You will start out assisting other designers on a project, learning about design patterns, creating wireframes, communicating your designs to stakeholders, scrum, etc. This helps you build a strong foundation of design skills.\n\nIf you already have some experience\nAs you grow, you run more projects and discover multiple parts of the design process like research and facilitation. Slowly taking on more responsibilities in projects. You will grow into the role that fits you like a glove, which can be a deep dive in specialised topics like UX research, UX design, animation or more broadly like facilitation and design ops related roles. You might even start to pick up some internal roles to share knowledge or help organising weekendjes weg.\n\nIf you are an experienced designer\nIf you've already gained a lot of experience we might consider you for the roles where you have autonomy and the responsibility for the overall quality of our projects. You fill roles where you are the lead designer, shaping the design proces at our clients, or defining and improving the standard we have for UX design or other design related topics.

You show a strong passion for digital product design and have a number of beautiful projects supported by a strong process to show for it. Being curious and thoughtful, you are focussed on quality. You have an eye for improvement and won\u2019t shy away from fruitful discussion.

Your independence in your roles and projects grows with the experience and expertise you get. You will start out assisting other designers on a project, learning about design patterns, creating wireframes, communicating your designs to stakeholders, scrum, etc. This helps you build a strong foundation of design skills.\n\nIf you already have some experience\nAs you grow, you run more projects and discover multiple parts of the design process like research and facilitation. Slowly taking on more responsibilities in projects. You will grow into the role that fits you like a glove, which can be a deep dive in specialised topics like UX research, UX design, animation or more broadly like facilitation and design ops related roles. You might even start to pick up some internal roles to share knowledge or help organising weekendjes weg.\n\nIf you are an experienced designer\nIf you've already gained a lot of experience we might consider you for the roles where you have autonomy and the responsibility for the overall quality of our projects. You fill roles where you are the lead designer, shaping the design proces at our clients, or defining and improving the standard we have for UX design or other design related topics.
