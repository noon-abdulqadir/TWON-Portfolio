This includes identifying communication objectives, messages and audiences and then producing strategic content that works to increase acceptability and visibility of MSF. Throughout, you are the spokesperson and voice of MSF.

ING’s global Model Validation IRRBB (“Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”) chapter is an energetic, diverse and collaborative international team consisting of about 15 highly qualified professionals of various quantitative backgrounds, located in Amsterdam.
Following ING’s Think Forward Strategy to become the next generation digital bank, data and models are considered key assets in our bank. As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

The role of model validator
As a model validator you focus on and further learn about the topics related to the models in your scope, using econometrics, quantitative finance, coding, business knowledge and related regulations. You perform in-depth analyses and write code to perform quantitative assessments. You summarize your analyses and conclusions in clear, fact-based and persuasively written reports, which are presented to the relevant Model Approval Committee. You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.
Your prospective model scope is broad and are related to the following main areas:
Behavioral: Modelling of mortgage & other loan prepayments and non-maturity deposits, as well as other embedded options in retail and wholesale products.
Interest rate: Market models (e.g. Hull-White model).
Valuation: Models used for calculating the economic value of a loan or deposit portfolio with embedded options.
Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.
Risk measurement: Models used for risk management and reporting (NPVaR, RRaR, NIIaR).
As part of the IRRBB chapter, you will contribute to further building and developing the team by sharing knowledge, coaching more junior staff and by embracing ING’s Agile way of working.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.

You allocate and distribute resources in the best way possible to guarantee seamless production, and report progress regularly to the CT Applications Manager. As an active member to the global production team, you work with other Process Supervisors to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You monitor results, proactively tackle issues in the process or applications and continuously improve.You like to lead a small team and you are not afraid to make decisions.

In this role you will use your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and achieve short and long-term business goals. You are flexible, hands-on and keep a good overview of the process and regularly monitor quality.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

Together with your team, you will produce and execute a yearly planning and allocate and distribute resources in the best way possible to guarantee seamless service for internal and external stakeholders.
Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections. You ensure the periodically monitoring of the collection’s conditions, implement and execute protocols to raise efficiency of the conservation of the seed collection and are responsible for the storage facilities.
As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.

The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.

You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development.

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. In order to explain this properly (and as briefly as possible) we have made an animation.
For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.

Together with your team, you will produce and execute a yearly planning and allocate and distribute resources in the best way possible to guarantee seamless service for internal and external stakeholders.
Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections. You ensure the periodically monitoring of the collection’s conditions, implement and execute protocols to raise efficiency of the conservation of the seed collection and are responsible for the storage facilities.
As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. In order to explain this properly (and as briefly as possible) we have made an animation.
For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

Together with your team, you will produce and execute a yearly planning and allocate and distribute resources in the best way possible to guarantee seamless service for internal and external stakeholders.
Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections. You ensure the periodically monitoring of the collection’s conditions, implement and execute protocols to raise efficiency of the conservation of the seed collection and are responsible for the storage facilities.
As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.
In short, you:
have a MBO+ or Bachelor degree;
have at least 5 year’s experience in a similar environment;
have at least 2 year’s experience as a team lead;
you have administration skills and good knowledge of Excel;
you have affinity with seeds;

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. In order to explain this properly (and as briefly as possible) we have made an animation.
For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections.

As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.

The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections.

As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. In order to explain this properly (and as briefly as possible) we have made an animation.
For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.

Enza Zaden is a vegetable breeding company that develops vegetable varieties. We produce and sell the seeds of these varieties all over the world. Both for conventional and organic growers. In order to explain this properly (and as briefly as possible) we have made an animation.
For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

For more than 80 years we are working with the best that nature offers. We support this with state-of-the-art technologies to speed up our breeding process. That is really necessary, because currently the development of a new vegetable variety takes up 6 to 10 years.
The results? Strong, healthy, tasty and climate-proof vegetable varieties with higher yield per square meter and less need of crop protection products or fertilizer.
Our strength? More than 2000 passionate colleagues worldwide working together on the vegetables of tomorrow. Therefore, we continuously invest in knowledge and skills with our Enza Academy and under the flag of enzActive we organise various sports activities to stay healthy.
Our head office in Enkhuizen is our home base, but we have colleagues throughout the world. Enza Zaden is an independent family company in which some 2,000 employees from over 40 nationalities spread across 6 continents work together closely in international teams.

Together with your team, you will produce and execute a yearly planning and allocate and distribute resources in the best way possible to guarantee seamless service for internal and external stakeholders.
Furthermore, you execute and improve protocols to optimise the conservation of gene bank crop collections. You ensure the periodically monitoring of the collection’s conditions, implement and execute protocols to raise efficiency of the conservation of the seed collection and are responsible for the storage facilities.
As an active member of the gene bank team, you work with our colleagues in other subsidiaries in order to bring efficiency and implement new methods and techniques. You check the results, proactively tackle issues in the process or the applications and improve on a continuing basis.
You report progress to the Manager R&D Business Support on a quarterly basis. Your line management role will guarantee an engaged team closely linked to other departments. You like to lead a (small) team and you are not afraid to make decisions. Your goal is to bring out the best in your team by coaching and motivation to secure continuous development. Because you will also assist the team on a daily basis you have a pragmatic and hands on attitude.
In this role you will utilize your experience and expertise to solve problems, develop and execute objectives for yourself and others, and realize short- and long-term business goals. You know how to prioritise tasks, keep a good overview of the process and monitor its quality regularly.
In short, you:

Leaseweb is a leading Infrastructure as a Service provider serving a worldwide portfolio of over 17,500 customers ranging from SMBs to Enterprises. We are looking for a Customer Service Representative to serve and assist our customers' needs during extended business hours, which means that you will be working in shifts in order to cover the timeframe from 08:00 until 20:00, Monday until Friday. We are looking for solution orientated, positive staff who have excellent verbal and written communication skills. Experience in the tech industry and SAP is a plus but the motivation and interest to learn is what will make you grow.

Our Customer Service Representatives are the first point of contact for our customers which means we are looking for candidates who can be the voice of our department. You will be working via telephone, chat, email and our ticketing systems which means multitasking is an everyday skill for the job.

Experience and requirements

Excellent verbal and written communication skills
Fluent English skills are essential, Dutch is a plus
1+ years in a customer service department is preferable
Experience with SAP is a plus
Ability to solve problems logically and critically
Demonstrate effective time management and organizational skills
A strong understanding of the internet and technical concepts is a plus (e.g. you understand the terms HTML, browser and cache)

Who are you

You like making things easier for customers and colleagues. If there's a roadblock, you want to smooth it away.
You are energized by interacting with and helping people. You know that everyone has trouble sometimes, and seek to empower and educate our customers.
You're a positive person and know how to look on the bright side.
You bring solutions to the table and you are not afraid to point out where we're going wrong.
You're comfortable with a little chaos and uncertainty. We move fast and sometimes decisions are made without all of the information.
You love reading and learning about new ways of doing things. There's always a better way.

Benefits include:

Participation in annual company bonus scheme, a company pension, and monthly Internet allowance
25 days of paid time off (and the option to buy or sell up to 5 more days)
Free lunch and parking, the best coffee (if we say so ourselves), and fresh fruit provided daily (when in the office)
Attractive relocation packages and an agency that takes care of the entire visa process
Access to the Leaseweb Academy, a personalized learning platform offering a variety of studies, courses, and trainings
Free in-house Dutch courses
Fun events year-round – from virtual pub quizzes to summer parties, company runs, quarterly hackathons and much more
Monthly after work drinks (also virtual, for now!)
A multicultural work environment (our colleagues in HQ alone are from over 40 countries!) in a company where you can truly make a difference

Unfortunately, we are not able to offer visa sponsorship for this role. Therefore, you need to be eligible to work in the Netherlands.
