22,production manager,Indeed,p_c80e0e7038c784ac,Head of Operations,VanMoof, Amsterdam,"We’re on the lookout for an experienced and forward-thinking company builder, with a sharp eye for detail, and a visionary operational perspective. As VanMoof's Head of Operations, you’ll professionalize the daily workings within a company growing at an exponential scale. Sound like your type of challenge? Keep reading!
VanMoof is growing – and we’re growing fast. We’re hiring a new Head of Operations to help us build a strong foundation for future growth. Your focus will be to scale and optimize fulfillment, touching on everything from the moment shipping containers leave production, to the second our riders begin on their VanMoof journey. You’ll take over the daily management of our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, direct warehouse processes, and oversee customer deliveries to streamline our day-to-day services. We’d also expect you to determine the elements that matter the most as we rapidly expand.
Our next Head of Operations is a focussed, strong communicator with a flair for problem solving, and a proven track record of success at the highest level. Your biggest challenge will be to implement the structures necessary for scaling up without compromising VanMoof’s hearty appetite for innovation and speed. You’ll approach any obstacles with a proactive, can-do attitude, and effectively direct a young and talented team.
Our ideal candidate will anticipate the potential bottlenecks as we pedal into the (occasionally bumpy) headwinds of change. Your willingness to lead by example and with experience will help propel VanMoof to new heights, and ultimately, get the next billion on bikes.
What you’ll do:
You’ll take care of day-to-day management and accountability for our planning, warehousing, and fulfillment activities on a global scale.
You’ll build, guide, and coach the operations team at our headquarters in Amsterdam, and in our key markets worldwide.
You’ll enable and optimize all operational aspects of our growth across multiple regions.
You’ll drive the implementation and improvement of our operational processes to increase standardization within the team, and across the company.
You’ll work to optimize our systems to reduce manual work.
What you'll bring:
10+ years of extensive experience in operations dealing with physical goods – and preferably within the world of online sales.
You have broad and considerable expertise in achieving operational excellence.
You have worked in – and were an instrumental part of – an organization that excels in large scale operations (including planning, logistics, and warehousing) and/or you have been part of an organization that succeeded in transformational growth.
You have a relevant network in operations (3PLs, logistics, warehousing).
You are process and system-orientated and know how to make an organization robust and future-proof by establishing processes without compromising our appetite for innovation and flexibility.
You know how to drive system (ERP) improvements.
You have a deep and specialized vision for Operations, and you’re able to effectively lead a young and talented team to reach the next level in their careers.
You are a problem solver, and always approach challenges with a can-do attitude.
You are entrepreneurial, proactive, and can lead by example.
What you'll get:
26 paid holiday days for you to unwind
Your very own VanMoof bike (lend-lease)
Laptop, screens, and software tools
Insider experience in a rapidly-growing international company
Healthy lunch provided (when we're back in the office!)
Special snacks, tasty coffee (and lots of tea) when in the office
Weekly bootcamp, weekly yoga, OneFit discount, and ClassPass credits
Discount on Dutch health insurance
About us:
We’re obsessed with cities. So are our bikes. Truly city-proof, they shrink long commutes, scare off bike thieves, and amplify your pedal power. We made it our mission to get the next billion on bikes. Join us on this journey.
Job descriptions are difficult to interpret. We understand you might not tick all the above boxes. The truth is, we don't either. If you feel excitement about our upcoming challenges, we encourage you to apply now!
