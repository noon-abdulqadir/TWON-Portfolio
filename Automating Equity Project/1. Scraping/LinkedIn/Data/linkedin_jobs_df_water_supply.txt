enhanced rural resilience Project,ZzLlKEM5ToWHrY53PKyDXw==,UNDP  United Nations Development Programme,"Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands","['Nonprofit Organization Management', 'Management Consulting', 'Government Administration']",Management,"Considering its economic structure and geographic features, Moldova is highly vulnerable to climate change and is exposed to disasters due to the hydrometeorological phenomena and natural hazards While drought and floods are among top hydrometeorological hazards caused by extreme weather and climate events, due to the current and projected abnormal high temperatures leading to water scarcity the incidence of forest fires is increasingly posing a threat to the natural ecosystems, agricultural system and human settlements With the projected decrease in surface water availability by 1620 by 2020 due to climate change, the water supply for all users requires adaptation options to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities related to water stress In Moldovas climate induced disasters are occurring more frequently and on a recurring basis, causing an average of 4 million US dollars per year of economic damage, , Climate scenarios also indicate the country is trending strongly towards becoming more arid This will intensify not only droughts but also fires Unfortunately, rural communities experience a capacity deficit in terms of fire prevention, preparedness and timely response mainly due to liquidation of over 400 equipped and capacitated firefighting units following the extensive privatization process from the 90s Subsequently, the intervention radius of 3 km according to norms increased to up to 1015 km in urban areas and 4050 km in rural areas where 70 of the total number of fires occur It resulted in increased response time and lower awareness of fire risks by the rural population, subsequently leading to considerable increase in loss of life, material damages and affected ecosystems It is widely accepted that rural women are disproportionately affected by fires due to them being mostly engaged in cooking in unsafe cookstoves and collection of firewood in ecosystems that might be at high risk of fires Overall, during 2008 and 2017, in Moldova were registered about 8 725 fires resulting in 1 356 deaths, including 61 children In the rural areas, poor and lowincome households are mostly exposed to fire risks due to also lack of proper fire prevention measures and adapted techniques, education and awareness, , Against this background, the project aims to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of rural communities to climate change and disasters through improved water storage infrastructures and disasters risk reduction measures The project is supporting implementation of climatesmart water management solutions for agriculture, flood management and fire prevention and expansion of communitybased rescuefirefighting teams in rural communities of Moldova with the purpose to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of the rural communities to climate change and disaster risks The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months and the activities are clustered around 2 major outputs intended to produce an impact in 5 districts of Moldova, Central Hincesti, Criuleni and Ungheni districts and Southern Leova and Cantemir, , The expected impact of the project is improved resilience of rural communities livelihoods in the face of climate change, , The overall project outcome is strengthened local policies, capacities and infrastructure which enable climate and disaster resilient development at the community level, , The projects outputs are the following, , Output 1  Adaptation interventions in the water sector for agricultural purposes and flood management demonstrated and local climate change related policy frameworks in place in a selected number of districts, , Output 2  Communitylevel climate and disaster management capacities improved for risk reduction, prevention and timely response, , Under the 1st Output 2 major activities will be implemented 11 Mainstream climate change adaptation and disaster risk management priorities into local development planning frameworks with intention to widely involve various stakeholders ranging from private sector to vulnerable groups out of which 50 will be women into policy and decisionmaking over priorities that affect their wellbeing and 12 Water storage infrastructures piloted in 5 districts of the country to enhance adaptation to climate change in the water and agricultural sectors by supporting with grants at least 15 farmers, including women, to put in place climatesmart water systems, such as for instance, water storage basins, , Under the 2d Output 2 major activities will be implemented 21 Establish Communitybased rescue and firefighting brigades in the most vulnerable and risk exposed districts of the country which are seen as an instrument for resilient community development that will cover up to 1020 km radius with maximum intervention time of 15 minutes and 22 Conduct capacity development for climate and disaster response local teams and raise awareness towards building a culture of safer living in order to ensure that the performance of the climate and disaster response local teams in the target communities is exercised at its full capacity and that the local population have an enhanced understanding of the response patterns in case of disasters, , The benefits of the project will materialize by increased water availability for resilient livelihoods, reduced exposure to disasters and fire risks for 55 villages approximately 58,714 people, includingwomen, where 990 households are identified as vulnerable 2930 vulnerable

enhanced rural resilience Project,ZzLlKEM5ToWHrY53PKyDXw==,UNDP  United Nations Development Programme,"Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands","['Nonprofit Organization Management', 'Management Consulting', 'Government Administration']",Water supply and waste management,"Considering its economic structure and geographic features, Moldova is highly vulnerable to climate change and is exposed to disasters due to the hydrometeorological phenomena and natural hazards While drought and floods are among top hydrometeorological hazards caused by extreme weather and climate events, due to the current and projected abnormal high temperatures leading to water scarcity the incidence of forest fires is increasingly posing a threat to the natural ecosystems, agricultural system and human settlements With the projected decrease in surface water availability by 1620 by 2020 due to climate change, the water supply for all users requires adaptation options to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities related to water stress In Moldovas climate induced disasters are occurring more frequently and on a recurring basis, causing an average of 4 million US dollars per year of economic damage, , Climate scenarios also indicate the country is trending strongly towards becoming more arid This will intensify not only droughts but also fires Unfortunately, rural communities experience a capacity deficit in terms of fire prevention, preparedness and timely response mainly due to liquidation of over 400 equipped and capacitated firefighting units following the extensive privatization process from the 90s Subsequently, the intervention radius of 3 km according to norms increased to up to 1015 km in urban areas and 4050 km in rural areas where 70 of the total number of fires occur It resulted in increased response time and lower awareness of fire risks by the rural population, subsequently leading to considerable increase in loss of life, material damages and affected ecosystems It is widely accepted that rural women are disproportionately affected by fires due to them being mostly engaged in cooking in unsafe cookstoves and collection of firewood in ecosystems that might be at high risk of fires Overall, during 2008 and 2017, in Moldova were registered about 8 725 fires resulting in 1 356 deaths, including 61 children In the rural areas, poor and lowincome households are mostly exposed to fire risks due to also lack of proper fire prevention measures and adapted techniques, education and awareness, , Against this background, the project aims to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of rural communities to climate change and disasters through improved water storage infrastructures and disasters risk reduction measures The project is supporting implementation of climatesmart water management solutions for agriculture, flood management and fire prevention and expansion of communitybased rescuefirefighting teams in rural communities of Moldova with the purpose to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of the rural communities to climate change and disaster risks The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months and the activities are clustered around 2 major outputs intended to produce an impact in 5 districts of Moldova, Central Hincesti, Criuleni and Ungheni districts and Southern Leova and Cantemir, , The expected impact of the project is improved resilience of rural communities livelihoods in the face of climate change, , The overall project outcome is strengthened local policies, capacities and infrastructure which enable climate and disaster resilient development at the community level, , The projects outputs are the following, , Output 1  Adaptation interventions in the water sector for agricultural purposes
