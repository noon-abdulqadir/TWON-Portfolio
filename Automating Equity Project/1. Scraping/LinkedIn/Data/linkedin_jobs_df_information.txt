76,information,Indeed,p_d098dc0ef6e4bbc5,Application Security Specialist,Securify, Amsterdam Westpoort,"Curious and eager to learn, people work together at Securify to share their passions: application security, hacking and security research - with enthusiasm.
We are out-of-the-box thinkers and see possibilities for an attack where others would drop out. We never stop learning, and stay cutting-edge by continuously sharing knowledge amongst each other, experimenting with new techniques, and conducting our own security research projects.
From our office in Amsterdam we work collaboratively as a team. This way, we can reinforce each other and find a solution together whenever someone gets stuck on something challenging. This is exactly the power of Securify - when combined, we possess all the necessary knowledge and skill to make the impossible possible - while often surprising our clients with the most (if we may say so ourselves) brilliant findings!
If this sounds appealing to you too, and you see yourself working in a vibrant start-up environment where everyone is working side by side on extremely cool things and creating something big, then we would certainly like to meet you!
The Securify match
There is no catch-all diploma or certification for creative thinkers with a strong hacker mind-set. Our team, therefore, consists of players with different backgrounds. Software development, electronics, informatics, graphic design, mathematics, and even psychology. Oftentimes, it’s people who have immersed themselves into (software) security out of their intrinsic drive and passion!
At Securify we are fully focused on application / software security. In our view, this is by far the most important part of cyber security! It encompasses our most personal information, and the totality of most business operations. We even entrust software with our health and lives. It is everywhere, impossible to ignore, and growing at unprecedented speed. It is our mission to help companies build and use software in a responsible and safe way, put an end to the stream of large data leaks and incidents, and create a safer digital future! We need a bunch of passionate heroes for that!
Investigating the security of applications happens from the outside (hacking) but also from the inside - the source code. In here all details and secrets are awaiting you to really dive into the security core!
Because of this, it is important that you are at least comfortable with reading source code - or even better still - have programmed in the past (as a job or from your own interest or hobby). Some examples of profiles that fit perfectly within our team:
Security-minded software developers who want to fully specialize in security.
You have completed your studies in software development or IT and are strongly interested in security / hacking.
You already work as an ethical hacker but would like to work within our team to get even better.
Security-minded software testers / IT engineers who are comfortable with reading source code.

In short, if you are an experienced developer or security specialist, or are a talent yearning to learn more and wants to fully specialize with us through a paid traineeship, then we would like to meet you!
Your primary activities
You will be involved in performing security assessments (hack tests and code reviews) on mostly web and mobile applications. In many cases we also have access to the source code during our research in order to get a better view of the internal workings of an application and potential security problems. During your research you will work actively with your colleagues and you will regularly contact clients to report on the progress or escalation of critical findings.
Once you are completely up to speed, you will coordinate projects independently from beginning to end. This includes the intake, in which you discuss the wishes and correct approach with the customer and also the findings meeting where you explain and demonstrate your findings.
Research time!
Increasing our knowledge is paramount to staying ahead. Of course, you will gain a lot of new experience from your research, but we also spend a lot of time actively building our knowledge. You will, for example, work on internal (security) research projects, participate in CTFs, work on new tools, attend conferences and (give) internal presentations in which you or your colleagues demonstrate their research or spectacular findings of the week.
To give an impression of our vulnerability research projects - our team already discovered critical zero-day bugs in products such as: Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Cisco, WD, Oracle, Citrix, Apache, Amazon, Seagate, Viber, Pinterest and Dell. All leaks were reported and dealt with in a responsible manner in cooperation with these organizations. In this way we contribute to the better protection of the millions of application users worldwide.
Have a look here for an overview of all our discoveries. We hope that you will be next on that list as our new employee!
Your work environment
You will come to work in a cosy, informal environment with a team of likeminded colleagues, all of which are enthusiastically engaged in their passion. The work will be very diverse because our assessments are typically short-term (1 to 4 weeks). You work with many different techniques and organizations, from small to large. One week you might assess a new Internet banking portal whilst hands-on testing a new app from a smart start-up after that.
By far the majority of assessments are carried out from our office in Amsterdam. In the case that is not possible (technically) it could be that you will visit clients to carry out (part of) the research at their location.
We’ve taken the ""play hard"" part a little too far now too. So, go insane on the table tennis table, during a game of Foosball with colleagues, or fuzzing, playing on one of our consoles, Arcade (soon), NERF guns or our cuddly mascot Tight-Tiger if you need some inspiration or love.
A regularly occurring treat is our epic dinners with the whole team, and we close the week with a nice drink that we often combine with random talks from colleagues. These talks can be about all kinds of subjects such as security research, the most beautiful hack of the week, new exploits, useful tools, trips to security conferences, but also own hobbies such as (Jan) brewing beer.
Lunch is catered, fruit is available daily in abundance, and on ""Pattata Friday"" we all go out for fun together.

135,information,Indeed,p_e2738b7a264d156c,Postdoc: Measuring predictive information in living cells.,AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Remarkable recent experiments have demonstrated that single-celled organisms are able to respond not only to experienced changes in the past, but also to expected changes that have yet to occur – evidently exploiting temporal correlations in the environment to predict the future. But how reliably can a cell make such predictions, which are the mechanisms that implement them, and what are their fitness benefits?

In this project, you will address these questions experimentally, using single-cell microscopy to precisely quantify (in bits) the amount of predictive information cells extract from past experiences. The primary experimental vehicle will be a single-cell FRET method developed in our group (Keegstra et al., 2017 eLife; Kamino et al., 2020, Science Advances). Your measurements will quantify information transmission and prediction in the E. coli chemotaxis system – a cell signaling network for which sufficient quantitative knowledge exists to address further questions about mechanistic origins and functional benefits of prediction. You will collaborate closely with the theory group of Pieter Rein ten Wolde (AMOLF), using concepts from information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to design and interpret experiments.

For further information on the project, contact Tom Shimizu (shimizu@amolf.nl).

We do this by offering a carbon reduction service.

We believe that for a better world without climate change, energy consumption must ultimately become fossil-free.

If nothing changes, by 2050, CO2 emissions of the whole transport sector, be it on our oceans, roads, or in the air, will be 60% higher than today. The energy transition for a cleaner, greener supply chain is too slow. Active intervention is required, by giving cargo owners the autonomy to use truly sustainable alternatives for fossil-fuel, and united, altering the course of transport as we know it in the immediate term.

Inform and advise our customers about the opportunities to decarbonize their freight and reduce their carbon footprint in the most effective way.
As we build long-term relationships with our existing customers, it is important to maintain good relationships with them and continuously challenge them to increase their CO2-emission reduction in various ways.
Understand the sustainability requirements of existing and future customers to ensure their needs are being met.
Share GoodShipping’s sustainable story at events, towards media and through other public communication channels.
Collaborate with our marketing and communications colleagues to make sure the message of GoodShipping is up to date and communicated in the right way through our website, social media, email newsletters, etc.

The ability to sell not only a product but also the wider story behind it. This ranges from involving the customer in the sustainability advantages to overcoming technical hurdles and creating a business case that works.
You are not afraid of prospecting and opening up the market through outbound and inbound channels.

241,information,Indeed,p_c3b4d058abef6a7c,PhD position 'Emotions in Romantic Relationships',Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, AmsterdamZuidoost,"This PhD position of four years is available at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam under the supervision of Dr. Francesca Righetti. The PhD position is funded by the VIDI grant for a project on Ambivalence and Emotions in Romantic Relationships



Location: Amsterdam

FTE: 1
Job description
It is an irony of life that the people we love the most, such as our romantic partners, are also the people towards which we can feel very strong negative emotions. When people hold strong mixed feelings (positive and negative) towards their partner, they are in a state called ‘Ambivalence’. However, while the experience of ambivalence in romantic relationships is pretty frequent, research on this phenomenon is extremely scarce. Thus, we need to know more about a phenomenon that is so pertinent and frequent in romantic relationships. With the use of different methodologies (e.g., both explicit and implicit measures), the current project will: 1) examine the different types of ambivalence that individuals can experience in their relationship to understand how each type of ambivalence affect the relationship dynamics between partners and people’s wellbeing; 2) examine how each type of ambivalence unfolds over time and under which conditions they are a precursor of relationship instability and dissolution; 3) test an intervention to reduce the aversive intra and interpersonal effects of the most malignant form of ambivalence. The projects will also examine how specific emotions affect relationship dynamics and how partners affect and regulate each other’s emotions. In the PhD project diverse methodologies (i.e., large scale longitudinal studies, diary studies, questionnaires, implicit measures, videotaped interactions, laboratory experiments) will be used to investigate these ideas.
Requirements
Research Master or Master in Psychology
Research training and experience
Excellent knowledge of methodology and statistics
Excellent command of written and spoken English
Good knowledge of office and statistical software (MS Office, SPSS, R)
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €2,395 (PhD)

and a maximum €3,061 (PhD), depending on your education and experience. The job profile: is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 1 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a duration of 3 years (so 4 years in total).


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:

a wide range of sports facilities which staff may use at a modest charge

About Rocket

We are a team of 200+ creative, young and open-minded people. For already two years Rocket helps home-birds, housewives, bachelors and a lot of other people in 27 cities of Ukraine. We partner with more than 3000 cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. We don’t plan to stop: in 2021 we are going to launch outside Ukraine. Not to space yet, but close to it. We started with an honest desire to create a great delivery service, which would be #1 in Ukraine. In March 2018 in Dnipro city we had only three couriers and delivered 83 orders from 5 restaurants. Over the next 12 months, we grew more than 100X times. Now — we can’t imagine the number of delivered orders, because it’s growing drastically literally every day.
Dialogue and total happiness of clients are very important for us. Couriers who work with our platform do not just bring orders; they bring atmosphere and mood. And if something went wrong — we are instantly here for you. No templates, just a sincere desire to help. So everything works like a mechanism, like a rocket. That’s why we are loved by customers, couriers, and partners too.
We want our clients to have more time for pleasant things in their lives, rather than for endless cooking, washing dishes or scrolling the news feed in numerous queues. It doesn't have to be that way.

285,information,Indeed,p_60d84d70eab5f5b6,Postdoc - mRNA translation in cancer,NKIAVL, Amsterdam,"Function description
The Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) in Amsterdam is a Comprehensive Cancer Centre combining a hospital and research laboratories in a single independent organization. The research group of Reuven Agami at the division of Oncogenomics is interested in identifying novel cellular vulnerabilities that can be exploited for cancer therapies. For this purpose, they develop innovative genomic and functional genetic tools and use biochemical and bioinformatics tools to understand the underlying mechanisms.

In recent years the Agami lab studied amino acid shortages and its impact on mRNA translation in cancer mainly using Ribosome Profiling and CRISPR-screens (Loayza-Puch et al., Nature 2016; Slobodin et al., Cell 2017; Sun et al., EMBO 2020). This research line has led them to uncover a surprising impact of amino acid shortages on proteins' quality. They showed that prolonged amino acid deprivation induces cancer cells to produce defective proteins by ribosomal frameshifting (Bartok et al., Nature 2020). These defective proteins can be processed and presented at the cell surface of cancer cells and be recognized by immune cells. They now aim to uncover the mechanisms that connect this phenomenon with cancer, setup functional genetic screens to identify underlying mechanisms and develop in vitro and in vivo tools to explore how to utilize this phenomenon for cancer immunotherapy.

Responsibilities:
The successful candidate will continue an ongoing research line in the lab to establish the link between defective protein production and cancer. He/she will perform functional genetic screenings and biochemical experiments in cell culture and mouse models to utilize this knowledge for cancer therapy. The successful applicant will also help in supervising PhD students in the lab and will be involved in writing of scientific papers, project reports and grant applications.
Job requirements
The Agami lab seeks to recruit an ambitious Postdoc with a strong background in molecular biology, and a strong commitment to science, who will be involved in constructing molecular strategies for functional genetics. A strong publication record is required. General knowledge in cancer biology and functional genetics with RNAi and CRISPR tools are an advantage. Bioinformatics skills are an advantage too. We expect the candidate to be highly self-motivated, creative, and able to work in a team. Apart from being a true team player, we expect the candidate to exhibit a high degree of independence, to have a problem-solving attitude and have strong analytical and technical abilities in addition to excellent communication and presentation skills.
Compensation
You will join an international research team in a stimulating and interactive research environment. The gross salary for a fulltime appointment will range from € 3.447,- to € 4.077,- per month, depending on previous experience. The terms of employment will be in accordance with FWG 55 of the CAO Ziekenhuizen (Collective Labour Agreement for Hospitals).

In addition you will receive a fixed end-of-year bonus in December (8,33%) and in May you will receive 8,33% holiday pay. For more information in regard to the secondary conditions please contact the recruiter via: c.de.santis@nki.nl.

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day. Our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!


Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to more than 500 Catawikians working across Europe and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.
So...What's the job?
