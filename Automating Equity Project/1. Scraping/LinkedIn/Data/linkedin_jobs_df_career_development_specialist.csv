Catawiki was founded in 2008; it was originally designed as a website where collectors could manage and keep track of their collections online. Visitors can still add new items to the existing catalog of collectibles. Unsurprisingly, the name Catawiki is a combination of the words 'catalogue' and 'wiki'. In 2011, Catawiki began hosting weekly auctions in various categories, including art, antiques, classic cars, watches, jewelry, fashion, books, and stamps.

Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Perfect Care Steam Generators, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world.

In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.

In its 128-year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.

How it all started

Catawiki was founded in 2008; it was originally designed as a website where collectors could manage and keep track of their collections online. Visitors can still add new items to the existing catalog of collectibles. Unsurprisingly, the name Catawiki is a combination of the words 'catalogue' and 'wiki'. In 2011, Catawiki began hosting weekly auctions in various categories, including art, antiques, classic cars, watches, jewelry, fashion, books, and stamps.

career development specialist,Indeed,p_bebe85a1d431306e,Customer Experience Specialist,Lepaya, Amsterdam Centrum,"Welcome to Lepaya

Our mission is to enable professionals across the globe to be more effective in their work and enjoy more happiness in life. Did you know that 85% of your effectiveness at work is determined by soft skills? To deliver on our mission, we deliver high impact soft skill training. Our training platform provides professionals with the more modern tools to develop themselves: online where possible, offline or face-to-face where that has more impact.

Why do we need you?

We are looking for someone that has passion for and experience in digital product development.
Over the past two years we have built a digital platform that supports and delivers our trainings through our own mobile app, and with integrations into tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

Right now, we are gearing up for another growth spurt. In the next couple of years we will roll out to numerous new countries and plan to serve even more clients. To do that we need to make sure that our platform and apps become even better, while we also make sure we can keep delivering this experience as more and more learners use our platform. Our product roadmap is ambitious and contains projects like creating a learner cockpit, personalizing the learning experience, scalable delivery, and many more. We need you to help us realize this roadmap and spot opportunities to enhance the roadmap.

Your role

Your role will be to help make our apps and platform better. You are part of the (digital) product development team and will report to the CPO. You will work closely together with our Product Owners and UX designers.
Your daily work will be to head several roadmap projects. We expect you to be very hands-on and pragmatic, and not just run a process. You will have to take these projects from the concept phase, come up with a solution and take it to a state from which the development team can start building the new features. In between, you have done the data analysis, customer research and combined these with a healthy dose of creativity and innovativity. You translate these solutions into clear requirements (epics and user stories) that the Tech Team can use to start actual technical development. Note: this role is not a customer service or customer representation role, experience in (digital) product development is required.

Specifically, what would we expect you to deliver over the next 6-12 months?
Set up a customer insights process in which we gather (automated) feedback from customers and learners every 3 weeks, the results of which are translated into user stories;
Analyze user behavior on our platform and based on this you have continuously improved our user flow leading to increasing our engagement metric by at least 20%;
You will lead and complete one to two roadmap initiatives per quarter in which you translate complex business problems to concrete requirements which are ready to be picked up by the development team;

In an ideal world, who would you be?
You have hands-on experience in developing a digital product;
You’re a critical thinker and a pragmatic contributor;
You like building new (digital) products and to be innovative in what you create;
You’re data driven, you value facts backed up by actual data over opinions;
You know how to drive a project forward, are independent in structuring, planning and executing projects;
You’ve experience in fast-paced and high-performing work environments;

We value capabilities over formal experience, yet what would we love to see on your resume?

4+ years of work experience (background at a strategy/management consulting firm is a plus);
Proven record in digital product development;
Master degree in relevant field;
Experience with handling data;

And of course, next to the challenge we offer, why is it amazing to work for Lepaya?

You will join an inspiring and dynamic environment;
You will participate in Lepaya’s own training curriculum;
We offer accelerated personal growth and career opportunities;
We offer an attractive compensation package;
And the best: participation in the Lepaya Work-To-Live schedule consisting of unlimited holidays & a free Friday every second week.

What is Lepaya?

Our mission is to enable professionals across the globe to be more effective in their work and enjoy more happiness in life. Did you know that 85% of your effectiveness at work is determined by soft skills? To deliver on our mission, we deliver high impact soft skill training. Our training platform provides professionals with the more modern tools to develop themselves: online where possible, offline or face-to-face where that has more impact.

We launched early 2018 and, the success of our approach is demonstrated by our rapidly expanding client-base - ranging from the most innovative and fast-growing scale-ups such as Bynder and Picnic, to global corporates such as ING, and L’Oreal.

We are now fully committed to rapid growth and international expansion, supported by a recent €5 mln Series A investment. This makes it the perfect time to step in. The new CX Specialist has the opportunity to work in a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment, where he/she plays a central role in achieving ambitious growth.

A word on diversity: at Lepaya, all we’re askin’ is a little respect! To us, it doesn’t matter where you were born, what you believe in, how old you are, what you look like, or who you love. We believe that different perspectives and backgrounds will actually lift Lepaya to new heights and increase our power of thinking.

How it all started

Catawiki was founded in 2008; it was originally designed as a website where collectors could manage and keep track of their collections online. Visitors can still add new items to the existing catalog of collectibles. Unsurprisingly, the name Catawiki is a combination of the words 'catalogue' and 'wiki'. In 2011, Catawiki began hosting weekly auctions in various categories, including art, antiques, classic cars, watches, jewelry, fashion, books, and stamps.

What’s in it for you?

Our core value is “people first” and this is incorporated in the way we work as well as in the way we reward our staff. Here, investing in knowledge, and sharing it, is highly valued and promoted. In addition to a generous, personal, “no questions asked” training budget, you can attend biweekly knowledge sharing sessions and six hackathons a year.

How it all started

Catawiki was founded in 2008; it was originally designed as a website where collectors could manage and keep track of their collections online. Visitors can still add new items to the existing catalog of collectibles. Unsurprisingly, the name Catawiki is a combination of the words 'catalogue' and 'wiki'. In 2011, Catawiki began hosting weekly auctions in various categories, including art, antiques, classic cars, watches, jewelry, fashion, books, and stamps.

The department of Marketing at the Amsterdam Business School (University of Amsterdam) invites applications for a PhD position in Marketing with a quantitative orientation. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.
What are you going to do?
The PhD position is a full-time position for a period of four years, starting date preferably 1 September 2021 or 1 January 2022. The first year will consist of PhD-level coursework, after that the candidate will start working on his or her own research agenda under the supervision of the supervisors. Jonne Guyt will be leading the supervisory team.
The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on tasks that include:
identifying novel research questions based on real-world phenomena or extant theory;
understanding the theoretical foundations and prior literature relevant to understanding the phenomena;
identifying the fundamental variables and relationships that are most important to studying the phenomena, and formalizing them in a measurement model or set of experimental hypotheses;
gathering experimental or observational data to test hypotheses or measure phenomena;
identifying the critical assumptions needed to draw inferences from empirical results;
writing code to analyse experimental or secondary data;
presenting research findings at international conferences;
writing up findings for publication in international journals;
attending classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to further develop thinking and research skills;
participating in and contributing to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, research meetings);
teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

The actual project will be defined by the student and the supervisory group and thus requires creativity, self-direction, and passion for top-notch scientific research. The research will be in the broader field of quantitative marketing, with a focus on consumers decisions. The project will be in line with the strategic priorities of the UvA that aim to promote societal impact and visibility of our research.
The PhD student will generate research that can be published in top-tier peer-reviewed journals in marketing, such as Journal of Marketing Research, Marketing Science, and Journal of Marketing. The research group has a strong record publishing in these and other top journals in related fields. The final results of the PhD project are published in a PhD dissertation, and most marketing PhD dissertations at ABS aim to be published in top-tier academic journals.
What do we require?
Formal requirements:

GMAT or GRE score of no more than five years old (for students with a Master degree obtained from a non-Dutch university). An indication of the minimum score required is 85%.;
proof of English proficiency through a TOEFL test (score of at least 100 on the internet based test and 600 on the paper based test) or IELTS test (minimum score of 7.5), where the scores were obtained no more than two years before the application.

Task-related requirements:
excellent speaking and writing ability in fluent English, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience;
willingness and motivation to independently formulate research projects and carry them through to completion;
excellent organizational skills;

Additional requirements:
strong motivation to pursue an international career as a leading scholar;
strong commitment to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
energy and passion for quantitative methods that allow for inferences on marketing phenomena (i.e., shown by choice of thesis topic or course specialization);
intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, and openness to criticism;
proof of 'good citizenship' beyond academic achievements (i.e., volunteering experience).
Our offer
We offer a full-time position (38 hours per week) for a period of four years starting 1 September 2021 or 1 January 2022. The employment contract will be for an initial period of 12 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months with a possibility to extend it for 24 months (in total 3 years).

The gross monthly salary will range from €2,395 in the first year to €3,061 in the last year. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.
What else do we offer?
The Marketing section of the Amsterdam Business School focuses on research in a wide range of topical areas and methods in marketing (consumer behavior, marketing strategy and quantitative marketing).

Welcome to the Juniper Way
Our mission to “connect everything, empower everyone” is built on the creativity and commitment of our people. We put Juniper on the map by being bold and acting as challengers, and we remain courageous as we evolve in our industry.

The experience on these pages will be rich in learning resources and support tools. Make time for development – a great way to learn and to lead is to seek out a mentor.
Build Trust
The trusted relationships we build with our colleagues and customers is the cornerstone to Juniper’s success. Trust must be cultivated and earned by demonstrating a commitment to shared success, a care for the individual and the team, and through consistent and respectful actions over time. It can be difficult to acquire, and when broken, even harder to redeem.
Deliver Excellence
Excellence is an outcome. We must strive for it in everything we do. It means we commit to consistently high standards in all we do – innovating, driving quality and ensuring rapid time-to-market – and pursue these goals with purposeful determination. We do not back down, make excuses or take the easy way out when the going gets tough. We persist, and we deliver.
Be Bold
We exist to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. We put Juniper on the map and secured a leadership position by being bold and acting as challengers. To stay at the top of our game, we must be courageous and constantly persevere in our pursuit of groundbreaking solutions to address our customers’ most difficult challenges. It’s innovate – or die.
Where will you do your best work?

About Juniper
Juniper Networks challenges the status quo…
…with innovative products, solutions and services critical to businesses by transforming the economics of networking in the connected world. We are pushing the limits of silicon, systems and software for unified environments and open architectures in our routing, switching and security solutions.
We are a leader in network automation, performance and creation. We create highly scalable, secure and cost-effective networks for unprecedented choice, agility, efficiency and value. We empower customers to unlock new business models and capitalize on new growth opportunities. We do so by challenging conventions to define what’s possible, not simply what’s next. Every product, solution and person who works at Juniper is driving business transformation that underpins the connected world.
Welcome to the Juniper Way
Our mission to “connect everything, empower everyone” is built on the creativity and commitment of our people. We put Juniper on the map by being bold and acting as challengers, and we remain courageous as we evolve in our industry. The trusted relationships we build with our colleagues and customers are the cornerstone to our success. And through it all, we strive for excellence.
This foundation is embodied in three values – Be Bold, Build Trust and Deliver Excellence, along with a set of refined behaviors for each. The experience on these pages will be rich in learning resources and support tools. Make time for development – a great way to learn and to lead is to seek out a mentor.
Build Trust
The trusted relationships we build with our colleagues and customers is the cornerstone to Juniper’s success. Trust must be cultivated and earned by demonstrating a commitment to shared success, a care for the individual and the team, and through consistent and respectful actions over time. It can be difficult to acquire, and when broken, even harder to redeem.
Deliver Excellence
Excellence is an outcome. We must strive for it in everything we do. It means we commit to consistently high standards in all we do – innovating, driving quality and ensuring rapid time-to-market – and pursue these goals with purposeful determination. We do not back down, make excuses or take the easy way out when the going gets tough. We persist, and we deliver.
Be Bold
We exist to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. We put Juniper on the map and secured a leadership position by being bold and acting as challengers. To stay at the top of our game, we must be courageous and constantly persevere in our pursuit of groundbreaking solutions to address our customers’ most difficult challenges. It’s innovate – or die.
Where will you do your best work?
Wherever you are in the world…
…whether it’s downtown California, London, Massachusetts, Amsterdam or Bangalore, Juniper is a place that was founded on disruptive thinking – where colleague innovation is not only valued but expected. We believe that the great task of delivering a new network for the next decade is delivered through the creativity and commitment of our people.

Trust must be cultivated and earned by demonstrating a commitment to shared success, a care for the individual and the team, and through consistent and respectful actions over time. It can be difficult to acquire, and when broken, even harder to redeem.
Deliver Excellence
Excellence is an outcome. We must strive for it in everything we do. It means we commit to consistently high standards in all we do – innovating, driving quality and ensuring rapid time-to-market – and pursue these goals with purposeful determination. We do not back down, make excuses or take the easy way out when the going gets tough. We persist, and we deliver.
Be Bold
We exist to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. We put Juniper on the map and secured a leadership position by being bold and acting as challengers. To stay at the top of our game, we must be courageous and constantly persevere in our pursuit of groundbreaking solutions to address our customers’ most difficult challenges. It’s innovate – or die.
Where will you do your best work?
Wherever you are in the world…
…whether it’s downtown California, London, Massachusetts, Amsterdam or Bangalore, Juniper is a place that was founded on disruptive thinking – where colleague innovation is not only valued but expected. We believe that the great task of delivering a new network for the next decade is delivered through the creativity and commitment of our people.

Welcome to the Juniper Way

The trusted relationships we build with our colleagues and customers are the cornerstone to our success. And through it all, we strive for excellence.

The experience on these pages will be rich in learning resources and support tools. Make time for development – a great way to learn and to lead is to seek out a mentor.
Build Trust
The trusted relationships we build with our colleagues and customers is the cornerstone to Juniper’s success. Trust must be cultivated and earned by demonstrating a commitment to shared success, a care for the individual and the team, and through consistent and respectful actions over time. It can be difficult to acquire, and when broken, even harder to redeem.
Deliver Excellence
Excellence is an outcome. We must strive for it in everything we do. It means we commit to consistently high standards in all we do – innovating, driving quality and ensuring rapid time-to-market – and pursue these goals with purposeful determination. We do not back down, make excuses or take the easy way out when the going gets tough. We persist, and we deliver.
Be Bold
We exist to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. We put Juniper on the map and secured a leadership position by being bold and acting as challengers. To stay at the top of our game, we must be courageous and constantly persevere in our pursuit of groundbreaking solutions to address our customers’ most difficult challenges. It’s innovate – or die.

In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
