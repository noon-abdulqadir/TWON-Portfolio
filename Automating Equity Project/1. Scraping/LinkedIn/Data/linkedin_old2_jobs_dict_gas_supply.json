and Services', 'Research', 'Financial Services']","Job Description":"Are you a highlymotivated student with excellent laboratory skills for performing stateoftheart quantum physics experiments on four of our projects, , The strontium quantum gases group is headed by Prof Florian Schreck and is part of the Quantum Gases and Quantum Information QGQI cluster at the University of Amsterdam Institute of Physics The main focus of the group is the exploitation of Sr quantum gases for novel precision measurement techniques and the study of manybody physics We have three open PhD positions within our Innovative Training Network MoSaiQC, which in this context are called early stage researchers ESRs, , , , , Steadystate atomic beam sources are crucial to realizing superradiant clocks and beneficial for quantum sensing with ultracold atoms in general We have developed a continuous beam of ultracold atoms of unprecedented brightness and phasespace density and can create steadystate BoseEinstein condensates This continuous source of atoms is one of the foundations of our attempts to develop continuous superradiant clocks within iqClock The source we have developed so far is rather large and needs to be shrunk in size and complexity to enable more researchers to use them and to bring them out of the lab into the field We are developing new concepts for generating ultracold strontium beams based on compact ovens, 2D MOTs, Grating MOTs and desorption cells The starting point of ESR1s project will be to develop and compare a range of different technology approaches and to build and characterize the best approach The ESR will then use the knowledge gained to advance our attempts to build continuous superradiant lasers and possibly even an atom laser Another aspect of ESR1s work will be to develop advanced laser sources The core of ESR2s project is to develop an ultrastable laser and use it for research ERS2 will build an ultrastable, highfinesse cavity and lock a laser to it such that it has a linewidth well below 1 Hz Light will be sent from this laser through phasestabilized fiber links to the superradiant clock we develop within iqClock and serve to characterize its precision These characterizations will be used to identify precision limiting effects and to improve the clock A further research opportunity is to use this laser for internal state control in our programmable quantum simulator Another aspect of ESR2s work will be the development of a scalable and simple system to lock all lasers required to operate a superradiant clock Highfinesse cavities loaded with ultracold atoms are a key to future applications harnessing strong atomlight interactions These include superradiant optical clocks, sensors, quantum memories, quantum simulation and quantum information processing As part of our goal of making a steadystate superradiant optical clock we are developing high finesse UHV vacuum cavities that can be loaded with ultracold strontium atoms For steadystate operation we need to continuously and efficiently load atoms from the ultracold strontium beam developed by ESR1 into the cavity Furthermore the atoms in the cavity need to be held tightly by a magic wavelength lattice, which doesnt shift the Sr clock frequency ESR3 will work closely with the iqClock team on all these topics, These ESR positions will be embedded within two projects please see Strontium quantum gas group, , , , , , You hold an MSc or equivalent in physics or a related field and are requested to motivate why you apply for the position and to supply a CV, , , , To foster diversity in our research group, we will especially appreciate applications from groups underrepresented in science, , , , , , A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years initial appointment will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years and should lead to a dissertation PhD thesis We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and international meetings We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students, , The salary,
