Would you like to work in an international research group in an academic environment? Please apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.


In medicine, the interest in molecular imaging has exploded in the last decade. Direct in vivo molecular imaging will become increasingly important as therapies become more specialized and molecule-specific to the disease. This requires visualizing molecular expression and molecular interaction at the cellular level and imaging in detail tissue structure and function in vivo .


The goal of the NWO-TTW Perspectief program “Medical Photonics - MEDPHOT” is to develop and validate photonics-based imaging technologies that enable earlier diagnosis and better and/or tailored treatment of diseases and translate these technologies to a clinical environment in collaborative projects with clinical opinion leaders in pulmonology, urology, and gastroenterology and industrial partners. Advanced physics concepts based on interferometry and cutting-edge technology will be developed to reach these goals.


Within the MEDPHOT program we focus on the development of hybrid optical technologies for combined structural and molecular specific imaging, including the development of novel catheters and capsules specifically optimized for combined detection. Specifically, at the VU high-end OCT systems will be developed that combine structural with targeted fluorescence imaging, i.e., an integrated immuno-OCT platform. New catheters will be designed for multifunctional imaging based on a double clad fiber design. In close collaboration with UMC Groningen (Prof. Nagengast), these catheters will be tested in pilot studies on patients. Algorithms to extract the scattering and absorbing properties of the tissues as well as the concentration of fluorescent contrast agents from the optical signals, for different tissues, will be developed. Polarization properties of tissue and materials have attracted interest in medicine and in industry. The detection of polarization changes are a prime interest, where these properties will be determined not only in tissue but also in collaboration with ASML in semiconductor materials.

In medicine, the interest in molecular imaging has exploded in the last decade. Direct in vivo molecular imaging will become increasingly important as therapies become more specialized and molecule-specific to the disease. This requires visualizing molecular expression and molecular interaction at the cellular level and imaging in detail tissue structure and function in vivo .


The goal of the NWO-TTW Perspectief program “Medical Photonics - MEDPHOT” is to develop and validate photonics-based imaging technologies that enable earlier diagnosis and better and/or tailored treatment of diseases and translate these technologies to a clinical environment in collaborative projects with clinical opinion leaders in pulmonology, urology, and gastroenterology and industrial partners. Advanced physics concepts based on interferometry and cutting-edge technology will be developed to reach these goals.


Within the MEDPHOT program we focus on the development of hybrid optical technologies for combined structural and molecular specific imaging, including the development of novel catheters and capsules specifically optimized for combined detection. Specifically, at the VU high-end OCT systems will be developed that combine structural with targeted fluorescence imaging, i.e., an integrated immuno-OCT platform. New catheters will be designed for multifunctional imaging based on a double clad fiber design. In close collaboration with UMC Groningen (Prof. Nagengast), these catheters will be tested in pilot studies on patients. Algorithms to extract the scattering and absorbing properties of the tissues as well as the concentration of fluorescent contrast agents from the optical signals, for different tissues, will be developed. Polarization properties of tissue and materials have attracted interest in medicine and in industry. The detection of polarization changes are a prime interest, where these properties will be determined not only in tissue but also in collaboration with ASML in semiconductor materials.

Would you like to work in an international research group in an academic environment? Please apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.


In medicine, the interest in molecular imaging has exploded in the last decade. Direct in vivo molecular imaging will become increasingly important as therapies become more specialized and molecule-specific to the disease. This requires visualizing molecular expression and molecular interaction at the cellular level and imaging in detail tissue structure and function in vivo .


The goal of the NWO-TTW Perspectief program “Medical Photonics - MEDPHOT” is to develop and validate photonics-based imaging technologies that enable earlier diagnosis and better and/or tailored treatment of diseases and translate these technologies to a clinical environment in collaborative projects with clinical opinion leaders in pulmonology, urology, and gastroenterology and industrial partners. Advanced physics concepts based on interferometry and cutting-edge technology will be developed to reach these goals.


Within the MEDPHOT program we focus on the development of hybrid optical technologies for combined structural and molecular specific imaging, including the development of novel catheters and capsules specifically optimized for combined detection. Specifically, at the VU high-end OCT systems will be developed that combine structural with targeted fluorescence imaging, i.e., an integrated immuno-OCT platform. New catheters will be designed for multifunctional imaging based on a double clad fiber design. In close collaboration with UMC Groningen (Prof. Nagengast), these catheters will be tested in pilot studies on patients. Algorithms to extract the scattering and absorbing properties of the tissues as well as the concentration of fluorescent contrast agents from the optical signals, for different tissues, will be developed. Polarization properties of tissue and materials have attracted interest in medicine and in industry. The detection of polarization changes are a prime interest, where these properties will be determined not only in tissue but also in collaboration with ASML in semiconductor materials.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1
Job description
For this project, we are looking for a PhD student who will develop the measurements systems, develop the advanced processing algorithms for polarization properties, polarization mode dispersion and quantitative fluorescence, and perform the data analysis of in vivo human data, as well as measurements on selected wafer samples provided by ASML. The research will be conducted at the VU in Amsterdam, with regular visits to the UMC Groningen. The candidate will be part of a larger group of PhD students that collaborate closely to reach the final goals of the MEDPHOT program, and are embedded in the Biophotonics research group at the VU under supervision of Prof. Dr. J.F. de Boer.


Your duties
the PhD student will further develop probes for the esophagus, collaborate on the further design and construction of the measurement systems, and develop an excellent understanding of light propagation principles and processing methods to extract tissue information as part of the MEDPHOT program. In collaboration with ASML, the optical properties of sample wafers will be studied
the PhD student will assist in clinical pilot studies by performing the data analysis and interpretation

Would you like to work for one of the leading E-Health tech companies here in the Netherland?
Do you enjoy working in an environment where you can have a lot of impact with systems that almost every person in the NL, can benefit from and even save lives?
Do you like many new construction issues that are developed with technologies such as: Scala, Akka HTTP / Streams, Kafka, Cats, Kubernetes, Docker, CQRS, AWS and Elasticsearch?

Don't wait any longer, we have the job for you!

Your employer: Leading E-Health Tech company knows how to surprise time and again with innovation

Ever since its foundation, decades ago, this medium-sized tech company has been a leader in the development of mission-critical E-Health solutions. 90% of primary care and all hospitals in the Netherlands depend on the products of this tech company. So you can say that people are making a huge positive impact here every day.

Through continuous innovation, people are able to raise the bar again and again and take healthcare in the Netherlands to a higher level. A completely new platform will be developed that will make a major contribution to the influence that we as a patient have on our care. So no longer dependent on choices of others, but also determine yourself about the care you receive. This will completely change the way we receive care in the Netherlands. In a positive sense then! This new platform has a lot of complex challenges, including scaling, which must be available to 17 million people in the Netherlands. You can work here with a nicemodern tech stack that includes Scala, Akka HTTP / Streams, Kafka, Cats, Kubernetes, Docker, CQRS, AWS and Elasticsearch.

All this has resulted in you working here in a proud and ambitious working environment with a high software engineering level. Yet people here have remained very informal, down to earth and the working atmosphere is therefore very relaxed with an excellent work-life balance. You will find a lot of flexibility here such as home working days, flexible times. There is enough room here for personal development and the disciplines here are divided over Squads, which together look at how organizations can continue to innovate broadly.

Does this sound like something to you?

Your role: Senior Scala developer Maarssen

In your role as Senior Scala Developer Maarssen you will work in one of the most innovative teams within the organization. Because new products are being developed here, you have a lot of greenfield and the amount of legacy code is limited to the minimum. The team is end to end responsible for its own product. You build it, you run it. You and your team of experienced Scala Developers are going to build a new product that will form a very important part of a mission-critical chain within healthcare. The challenge here is that it is a chain with very complex processes, within a very complex domain. The challenge is to automate this with software engineering best practices such as clean coding. If you like complex puzzles, then you've come to the right place.

What is being asked?
BSc or MSc Computer Science or comparable level
Minimum 5 years of professional Software Development experience
Experience with Scala from own project, professional or Coursera course
Experience with Akka HTTP/Stream and/or Cats is a plus
Experience with Kafka and / or Kubernetes is an advantage
Experience with Docker and / or CQRS is an advantage
Experience with NoSQL technology is a plus
Experience with AWS is an advantage
Experience with Logstash and / or Gatling is an advantage
Experience with Continuous delivery and deployment is a plus
Experience with Automated Testing is a plus
What is offered?
Salary between € 70.000 and € 85.000 per year
2-3 days working from home
25 vacation days, but free extra days if you need more :-)
pension plan
Very flexible working hours
The best hardware
Travel allowance

Would you like to work for one of the leading E-Health tech companies here in the Netherland?
Do you enjoy working in an environment where you can have a lot of impact with systems that almost every person in the NL, can benefit from and even save lives?
Do you like many new construction issues that are developed with technologies such as: Scala, Akka HTTP / Streams, Kafka, Cats, Kubernetes, Docker, CQRS, AWS and Elasticsearch?

Don't wait any longer, we have the job for you!

Your employer: Leading E-Health Tech company knows how to surprise time and again with innovation

Ever since its foundation, decades ago, this medium-sized tech company has been a leader in the development of mission-critical E-Health solutions. 90% of primary care and all hospitals in the Netherlands depend on the products of this tech company. So you can say that people are making a huge positive impact here every day.

Through continuous innovation, people are able to raise the bar again and again and take healthcare in the Netherlands to a higher level. A completely new platform will be developed that will make a major contribution to the influence that we as a patient have on our care. So no longer dependent on choices of others, but also determine yourself about the care you receive. This will completely change the way we receive care in the Netherlands. In a positive sense then! This new platform has a lot of complex challenges, including scaling, which must be available to 17 million people in the Netherlands. You can work here with a nicemodern tech stack that includes Scala, Akka HTTP / Streams, Kafka, Cats, Kubernetes, Docker, CQRS, AWS and Elasticsearch.

All this has resulted in you working here in a proud and ambitious working environment with a high software engineering level. Yet people here have remained very informal, down to earth and the working atmosphere is therefore very relaxed with an excellent work-life balance. You will find a lot of flexibility here such as home working days, flexible times. There is enough room here for personal development and the disciplines here are divided over Squads, which together look at how organizations can continue to innovate broadly.

Does this sound like something to you?

Do you want to fully help multiple organizations with millions of end users into the Cloud?
Would you like to work for a very successful 100% open source minded tech organization from which many very successful worldwide used software products have emerged?
Do you enjoy working on varied, long-term new construction projects from your own office in Amsterdam?
Your employer: open source stronghold around distributed systems

This medium-sized software company has for years been at the forefront of building highly distributed, competitor and mission critical systems that beat the hard of their customers. These systems are already running or have yet to be migrated to a Cloud Native environment. The great thing is that you always work from the office in Amsterdam, together with your colleagues!

With a fiery passion for open source (many commiters), built various commonly used frameworks and several very successful product companies emerging within the walls, you can speak of a true knowledge center around modern application building based on the most modern (java / kotlin) stack! Many of their products and customers are now migrating to a Cloud Native environment, so that as a Devops Engineer you can have a major impact here and work within most modern complex Cloud environments. They are happy to share this knowledge. They regularly speak at seminars, organize many meetups and invest heavily in self-development for you and your colleagues.

The culture is super informal, accessible, enterprising and very knowledgeable. Your colleagues are all people with a passion for building high-quality software. If you are interested in concepts such as scalability, Cloud Native, microservices and building infrastructures, but you don't want to spend years in the same place, this is your option!

Your role: Senior Devops Engineer Amsterdam GCP

As a Senior Devops Engineer Amsterdam GCP you always work with your colleagues in Amsterdam within one of the scrum teams to guide software solutions to the Cloud. The big advantage is that you have the variety of projects, but always work from the office and therefore do not have to visit customers!

You will have the opportunity to set up infrastructure within the Cloud for different organizations with different challenges and scales, mainly working with GCP, Kubernetes and Helm. You and your team also ensure that CI / CD pipelines are set up and automated, Cloud environments of different customers remain in the air and you set up Cloud environments for different customers.

A major project will follow shortly, for which a new team of several Cloud Devops specialists will be set up. You will have the opportunity and freedom to form this team and, together with your colleagues, set up the infrastructure from scratch for a self-developed tool for larger organizations with millions of end users. Together with your team, you will ensure that this tool and the platform run completely within a Cloud Native environment.

Because you work in a team with the people of your organization, you always deliver projects based on your standards. In this way you guarantee that it meets what you have in mind. You can of course also continuously spar with your direct colleagues, which leads to even better and faster results.

Given their experience in successfully setting up various product companies, you will also find a unique opportunity to set up one of your own ideas in the future under the guidance of heavyweights!
