position is funded by the Delft Blockchain Lab DBL, httpswwwtudelftnldelftblockchainlab, which is the TU Delft initiative that brings all blockchainrelated research at TU Delft together, , Current

modernday threat, as shown by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 More recently, nineteen zeroday vulnerabilities have been identified in a widely used industrial TCPIP stack, dubbed

probability and numerical simulations, The theory of random graphs has attracted great interest in the last years due to their application to realworld networks In the present project we will study different types pf spin systems on the ErdosRenyi random graph and investigate their dynamical properties with a special focus on metastability Systems subject to random dynamics exhibit metastability

Tools That Aid Language Designers In Defining And Implementing Languages In a Way That Strikes a Balance Between, , Definitional interpreters are an attractive style of language definition, since they are executable by construction The key idea of a definitional interpreter is to define an object language by implementing an interpreter for it in a second, betterunderstood metalanguage There is no shortage of metalanguages that can be used to implement definitional interpreters, but existing metalanguages do not strike a satisfactory balance between declarativity, executability, and verifiability Executability and efficiency typically comes at the cost of sacrificing declarativity and verifiability, and vice versa The proposed PhD project revolves around the development of a new language for defining languages that addresses this shortcoming The vision is to provide a framework and tool that generates efficient language run times from declarative and verifiable language definitions The goal of the PhD project is to contribute to this vision, , , , , , Recent work on scopesandframes introduced a set of memory primitives for implementing lexical name binding such as binders in  calculus, and nonlexical name binding such as module imports, class inheritance, etc, , But, to date, scopesandframes have not been integrated into any definition language that strikes a balance between the concerns above, , , There are several research objectives that could be explored as part of this project For example, , , , , We are looking for a versatile candidate who can contribute to the development of theoretical foundations, design of metalanguages, implementation and integration of languages and libraries in the language workbench, and evaluate the new techniques

Delft","Location":"Delft, South Holland, Netherlands","Industry":"['Information Technology and Services', 'Higher Education', 'Research']","Job Description":"Job Description, , The Intelligent Electrical Power Grids IEPG section within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at TU Delft has a very ambitious and diversified research programme covering major technological challenges concerning the operation and planning of future power grids IEPG is expanding the research programme on cyber security and resilience of power grids to cyber attacks The postdoctoral candidate is expected to conduct research on blockchainbased cyber security to improve the resilience of future power systems with high shares of Distributed Energy Resources DERs This position is funded by the Delft Blockchain Lab DBL, httpswwwtudelftnldelftblockchainlab, which is the initiative that brings all blockchainrelated research at together, , Current Practice The electric distribution network that prevails all over the world follows a centuryold topdown structure This is centrally operated by Distribution System Operators DSOs, which monitor and control the high and medium voltage networks Typically, the Low Voltage LV network is not observable High shares of DERs are deployed at all voltage levels in the distribution network to tackle climate change and reduce our carbon footprint However, the distribution network currently lacks the necessary cyber security and resilience to prevent cyber attacks on DERs, grid edge devices, and associated electricity infrastructure, , Problem Description The increased grid digitalisation has brought forth cyber attacks and threats as major risks Cyber attacks on power grids are a real modernday threat, as shown by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 More recently, nineteen zeroday vulnerabilities have been identified in a widely used industrial TCPIP stack, dubbed Ripple20 The Ripple20 investigations demonstrate Internet of Things IoTbased vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to gain access to and modify critical Operational Technology OT and IoT networked components This poses a major threat to the future power grid with high shares of OT and IoTenabled DERs Cyber attacks are becoming more advanced and focused, bypassing networklevel protection to target specific industrial IoT devices Coordinated and simultaneous cyber attacks on aggregated DERs can have a large impact on power system stability, which may cause cascading failures and a blackout The grid edge is becoming too shaky to shield with traditional defences Smart grid cyber security is needed to protect every digital interaction between DERs and grid operators in the LV network An increasingly open and transactional grid edge stresses the need to enforce the smart grid defences with blockchain, , , , What is needed from you The postdoctoral candidate will develop blockchain cyber security technology to help secure distributed energy resources at the grids edge with the overall aim to improve cyber security and grid resilience to cyber attacks More specifically, you will develop advanced monitoring, control, and communication frameworks for embedded DERs enabled through blockchain to further build the foundation for a decarbonised, digitalised, and decentralised grid, while making it more resilient from a cyber security perspective Blockchain provides a highly structured and immutable audit trail, complete with the identity of every actor in the cyberphysical system It offers enhanced capabilities to verify the integrity of measurements and control setpoints for DERs and detect any data alteration by attackers This makes the grid edge cyber resilient The expected outcome is a distributed, scalable, and cyber secure architecture using blockchain technology that enables visibility, control, and security of grid edge DERs with the required speed and scale The outcome of this research directly contributes to the cyber resilience of future power systems with high shares of OT  IoTenabled DERs, , The candidate has a PhD in computer science, mathematics, electrical engineering or a similar discipline and experience in blockchain technology eg, hyperledger and cyberphysical security, , , , Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement

on blockchainbased cyber security to improve the resilience of future power systems with high shares of Distributed Energy Resources DERs This position is funded by the Delft Blockchain Lab DBL, , which is the TU Delft initiative that brings all blockchainrelated research at TU Delft together, , Current Practice The electric distribution network that prevails all over the world follows a centuryold topdown structure This is centrally operated by Distribution System Operators DSOs, which monitor and control the high and medium voltage networks Typically, the Low Voltage LV network is not observable High shares of DERs are deployed at all voltage levels in the distribution network to tackle climate change and reduce our carbon footprint However, the distribution network currently lacks the necessary cyber security and resilience to prevent cyber attacks on DERs, grid edge devices, and associated electricity infrastructure, , Problem Description The increased grid digitalisation has brought forth cyber attacks and threats as major risks Cyber attacks on power grids are a real modernday threat, as shown by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 More recently, nineteen zeroday vulnerabilities have been identified in a widely used industrial TCPIP stack, dubbed Ripple20 The Ripple20 investigations demonstrate Internet of Things IoTbased vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to gain access to and modify critical Operational Technology OT and IoT networked components This poses a major threat to the future power grid with high

attacks on aggregated DERs can have a large impact on power system stability, which may cause cascading failures and a blackout The grid edge is becoming too shaky to shield with traditional defences
