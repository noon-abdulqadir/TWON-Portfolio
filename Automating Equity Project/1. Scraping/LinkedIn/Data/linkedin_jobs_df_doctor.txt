5,doctor,Indeed,p_aa7fe09495081e39,Postdoc: Single-cell dynamics in intestinal organoids,AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Organoids are miniature organs that display the striking ability to grow and self-organize from single adult stem cells. Recently developed techniques are now making organoids an exciting system for quantitative (biophysics) studies. You will use advanced 3D fluorescence time-lapse microscopy (confocal and light-sheet), machine-learning enabled tracking of individual cells, statistical data analysis methods, and organoid growth technology, to follow all cellular lineages in time and space over multiple generations and to hence elucidate how organoids form and function.

Specifically, this project focusses on a class of rare cell types (enteroendocrine, Tuft, and microfolds cells). These cell types are poorly understood, yet are thought to play crucial roles in hormone production and immune defense, and hence are implicated in conditions including allergies, obesity, depression, and auto-immune diseases. You will study the yet-unknown dynamics of these cell types: their shape changes, movement, spatial organization, differentiation from other lineages, and notably, their interaction with bacteria and immune cells. These data will give unprecedented insight into these remarkable cell types and their functions.
About the group
This project will take place jointly in the Tans and van Zon labs at AMOLF Amsterdam. It is part of a larger program together with the Snippert lab at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), the Van Rheenen lab at the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) and the Clevers lab at the Hubrecht institute, the ten Wolde lab at AMOLF, and the Simons lab in Cambridge, and hence brings together a range of cutting-edge approaches in organoid technology, genetic engineering, in-vitro and in-vivo microscopy, single-cell sequencing, data analysis, and mathematical modelling.

About the group
Biophysics, Quantitative Development Biology
Qualifications
We are looking for an outstanding experimental physicist, chemist, or biologist with skills in handling complex data and an interest in fundamental questions about development, and a strong drive to excel in a competitive international environment. You need to meet the requirements for a doctors-degree and preferably have research experience in a non-Dutch academic environment. Prior experience with quantitative (light-sheet) microscopy, organoid/tissue culture or quantitative analysis of single-cell behavior is not required, but is considered a plus.
Terms of employment
The position is intended as full-time (40 hours / week, 12 months / year) appointment in the service of the Netherlands Foundation of Scientific Research Institutes (NWO-I) for the duration of three years. AMOLF assists any new foreign postdoc with housing and visa applications and compensates their transport costs and furnishing expenses.

8,doctor,Indeed,p_9e2332736ef40fc3,"Postdoc: Ubiquitin-mediated protein processing at the single-molecule level, using optical tweezers and fluorescence",AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Protein chains undergo dramatic changes during their lifetime, beyond their initial folding. Eukaryotic cells possess an intricate ubiquitin protein ‘labelling’ system to regulate these changes. The aim of this project is to reveal the dynamics of this system at the single-molecule level for the first time. You will use advanced optical tweezers with combined single-molecule fluorescence and novel biochemical approaches to directly measure the striking hypothesized motor-like movements, complex interplay between protein chain folding, unfolding, and translocation, and to elucidate the mysterious role of the branched protein chain topology of these substrates. These experiments will provide unprecedented dynamic insights at the nanoscale level of this remarkable protein processing system.

This project has now become possible owing to recent technical advances, including the new in vitro assays of our collaborators, novel structural approaches, and optical tweezers techniques pioneered by our lab. The latter have previously shown how chaperones extend, clamp, confine, and processively pull on protein chains (Science 2007, Nature 2013, Nature 2016, Nature 2020). You will develop novel single-molecule approaches, automated data analysis methods, and help define innovative molecular biology methods, in order to enable this first dynamic view on ubiquitin-mediated protein chain processing.

Elucidating how this system works dynamically is of tremendous importance, given its central operation throughout the cell, for instance in regulating chromatin remodelers, key cell-cycle complexes, cytoskeletal organization, and more generally in maintaining the balance of protein error and repair, and is therefore also implicated in a wide spectrum of medical conditions. This project thus provides the opportunity to bridge the gap between single molecule events and crucial cellular function and malfunction.

15,doctor,Indeed,p_e2738b7a264d156c,Postdoc: Measuring predictive information in living cells.,AMOLF, Amsterdam,"Remarkable recent experiments have demonstrated that single-celled organisms are able to respond not only to experienced changes in the past, but also to expected changes that have yet to occur – evidently exploiting temporal correlations in the environment to predict the future. But how reliably can a cell make such predictions, which are the mechanisms that implement them, and what are their fitness benefits?

In this project, you will address these questions experimentally, using single-cell microscopy to precisely quantify (in bits) the amount of predictive information cells extract from past experiences. The primary experimental vehicle will be a single-cell FRET method developed in our group (Keegstra et al., 2017 eLife; Kamino et al., 2020, Science Advances). Your measurements will quantify information transmission and prediction in the E. coli chemotaxis system – a cell signaling network for which sufficient quantitative knowledge exists to address further questions about mechanistic origins and functional benefits of prediction. You will collaborate closely with the theory group of Pieter Rein ten Wolde (AMOLF), using concepts from information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to design and interpret experiments.

For further information on the project, contact Tom Shimizu (shimizu@amolf.nl).
About the group
For more information about research in the Shimizu Group, see https://amolf.nl/research-groups/systems-biology.
Qualifications
You need to meet the requirements for a doctors-degree and must have research experience in a non-Dutch academic environment.

We seek candidates with a strong background in experimental physics or quantitative biology and an interest in the biophysics of cellular information processing. Prior experience with microscopy is preferred.
Terms of employment
The position is intended as full-time (40 hours / week, 12 months / year) appointment in the service of the Netherlands Foundation of Scientific Research Institutes (NWO-I) for the duration of two years.

We welcome applications from individuals of all genders, ages, sexual orientations, nationalities, races, religions, beliefs, ability status, and all other diversity characteristics.

Objectives and responsibilities of the position

A specialist position leading context analysis, documentation and response to protection issues and humanitarian dilemmas, understanding and safeguarding humanitarian principles, and linkage of MSF operations with wider humanitarian debates. Dependent on context, humanitarian affairs within MSF may involve several complimentary lines of activity:

Context analysis, stakeholder mapping, research and monitoring of (especially protection-related) issues and humanitarian dilemmas in contexts where MSF is present;
Field data collection and engagement with affected communities in support of MSF humanitarian objectives;
Identification of priorities for MSF advocacy and the development, coordination and implementation of appropriate advocacy strategies and approaches targeting priority stakeholders;

Core context analysis activities may include working with project teams to gather information, document and monitor violence against civilians, targeted exclusion of affected communities, barriers to access to humanitarian assistance, population movement and displacement, violence, bureaucratic impediments and/or de-legitimisation or criminalisation of principled humanitarian. Analysis and targeted research is conducted within the framework of local legal frameworks, International Humanitarian and Human Rights Law (IHL & IHRL) and established principles of humanitarian action.

Field data collection and engagement with affected communities may include the ethical collection of testimonies of affected community members, or the design and implementation of field data surveys to establish evidence bases of advocacy or amplify the voices of communities and individuals with whom MSF stands in solidarity.

The development, coordination and implementation of advocacy strategies includes working closely with MSF project teams, heads of mission, medical coordinators and operational communications personnel to prioritise issues and objectives for MSF advocacy, develop strategies and approaches to influence key stakeholders, and coordinate implementation of advocacy via targeted messaging, relationship-building and other available means
Assignments may be limited to the definition or implementation of MSF advocacy on specific issues and topics, or broader to include the development of new priorities and approaches. You support or are part of MSF mission Management Teams in countries undergoing humanitarian crises, often due to armed conflict. In this capacity you may be call on to propose or debate appropriate priorities, strategies and courses of action with senior field management.

Humanitarian affairs work rests on strong analytical skills and requires the ability to synthesize complex field realities so as to prioritize core concerns and guide MSF organizational positioning and advocacy activities. Humanitarian Affairs Officers and Advocacy Managers work closely with MSF Heads of Missions, Medical and Project Coordinators, and especially Operational Communications Personnel.
