MSF coordinates operations through collaborations between global offices.

Objectives and responsibilities of the position
As a mental health officer you will create, implement and improve treatment programmes for patients with conflict-related problems and/or mental health conditions.

Most of MSF’s mental health programmes aim to provide people in emergency and conflict areas with acute mental healthcare and psychosocial support.

A substantial part of your work will involve training and supervising local staff who carry out the psychosocial support activities. Data collection, analysis and reporting are an intrinsic part of the role.
