67,sport,LinkedIn,2319821445,Ph.D. positions on ... - Eindhoven,CBFBq6DVTkaN0o4uRqwT5w==,IamExpat,"Eindhoven, North Brabant, Netherlands","['Information Technology and Services', 'Research', 'Financial Services']","The Center for Wireless Technology Eindhoven CWTe of the Electrical Engineering EE department of TUe has two open PhD positions as part of the recently granted European project Horizon 2020 ADENEAS Advanced Data and power Electrical Network Architectures and Systems ADENEAS aims at developing advanced technologies for intraaircraft data communication and power distribution One of the technologies for data distribution that ADENEAS will investigate is ultra reliable wireless communicationIn the case of avionics, the most important advantages of wireless systems are weight reduction, resulting in less fuel consumption, flexibility, ease of layout, maintenance and modification Despite their advantages, wireless technologies have been hardly adopted in aviation where most intraaircraft connectivity relies on wired technologies The use of wireless technologies is limited to inflight online interconnectivity for the customers and to inflight entertainment The main reason for this is that current wireless technologies are not able to provide the reliability, security, and lowlatency levels needed to effectively support the operation of the various aircraft functionsADENEAS will investigate techniques to guarantee high levels of reliability in wireless networks inside aircrafts, comprising robustness for interference, failure and attacks, and with high levels of availability, flexibility, and dealing with stringent latency constraints The main idea is to combine innetwork intelligence with diversity at several layers of the protocol stack At the physical layer the approach is to rely on cognitive radio and software defined radio SDR technology for creating robustness, adapting and optimizing the radio communication to the channel conditions and, ensure interoperability and upgradability to new and evolving standards Besides making use of wellknown diversity techniques at the physical layer such as channel coding and multiple antennas, the project will investigate diversity techniques at the link and network layers It is the intention to investigate intelligence mechanisms embedded in the network that, in addition to supporting selfconfiguration, selforganization and selfhealing, will be able to detect, localize, analyze and predict connectivity disruptions and attacks and consequently take the necessary countermeasures The proposed techniques will be validated using simulation tools and experimental set upsOne PhD position is intended to investigate multilayer diversity techniques and innetwork intelligence for ultrareliable reliable wireless communication This position will be embedded in the Electrooptical Communication ECO group The second PhD position targets softwaredefined radio and cognitive radio techniques and will be embedded in the Integrated Circuit IC group The two PhD researchers are intended to work closely together in the context of the CWTe The CWTe is a collaboration of five research groups of the Electrical Engineering department of Eindhoven University of Technology TUe Electromagnetics EM, Integrated Circuits IC, Signal Processing Systems SPS, Electronic Systems ES and Electrooptical Communication ECOThe Center focuses on four programs UltraHigh DataRate Systems, UltraLow Power and InternetofThings Communication, Terahertz Technology, and Radio Astronomy Together, these programs cover a range of topics such as antenna design, wireless power transfer, data conversion, RF circuit design, signal processing, communications baseband algorithms, and optical and wireless access network design CWTe continuously develops a vision for each of the programs, their applications, and supporting technologiesThe UltraHigh DataRate Systems program covers network architectures and system design for highspeed, highcapacity wireless communications aiming at solutions for pushing data rates toward terabits per second The UltraLow Power and InternetofThings Communication program focuses on the spectrum and energy efficiency of the IoT, such as ultralowpower circuitry and protocols The goal is to develop enabling techniques for massive and dependable energyefficient communication networks The Terahertz Technology program is working on the next step to realize miniaturized and affordable terahertz systems It will be these systems that will bring the wealth of terahertz applications from the laboratory to the real world where companies, medical centers and consumers will profit from the special detection and imaging properties of this frequency range Finally, the Radio Astronomy program focuses on designing the next generation of radio telescopes The universe has never been properly mapped at low frequencies below 30 MHz, and this research contributes to a spacebased radio telescope with the goal to look deeper into spaceThe CWTe integrates various laboratories designed for research on wireless antennas covering an area of 700 square meters from nearfield scanning the testing of antennas in a small space, to the testing of new chips on wafers The facilities include a fully shielded metal room in which the most sensitive electronics can be measured In a system integration lab, chips can be linked to other components There is a traditional anechoic chamber of 28mfacilitates antenna measurements from 500MHz till 40GHz Next to classical farfield measurements it also supports planar nearfield measurements of large connectorized antenna systems In particular, the combination of the various laboratories and the clustering of the associated expertise in one place make the CWTe unique in Europe, , , , , , , , 38 hours per week, , , , De Rondom

General Advanced materials, materials applications and manufacturing methods rely on the fundamental understanding of the physics and mechanics of the underlying microstructure and the influence of complex processing steps affecting this microstructure, governing the mechanical behaviour of materials under various loading conditions The development of this fundamental understanding requires bridging the gap between science and technology in the area of processing, analysis and design, through the use of novel experimental and computational tools The experimental analysis, theoretical understanding and predictive modelling of a large range of problems in materials engineering involve different length scales, each of which necessitates dedicated experimental andor computational tools Predictive methods to coarse grain or homogenize from small scales to engineering scales are thereby of key importance Function integration in material systems Conventional materials are endowed with a morphology and microstructure that is designed and processed upfront, and which is not purposely altered thereafter Allowing materials to change morphology and properties over time the 4th dimension in a controlled manner, enables materials to behave as actuators or sensors, or to be programmable This development can be extended towards designing and creating materials, ie designer materials, which are functionally integrated systems, ie the material becomes the system This development is stimulated by ongoing materialdriven miniaturization and function integration Development, optimization and behaviour of new advanced materials Additive Manufacturing AM has huge potential and is widely advertised as the next industrial revolution, but there are still major hurdles related to the materials behaviour under the AM processing regime in relation to the desired functionality This specifically applies to hybrid materials, which are key for the nextgeneration engineering
