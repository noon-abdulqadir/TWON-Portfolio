Standing on years of experience and a reputation for offering world-class psychedelic retreats, Synthesis is uniquely qualified to set the standard for practitioners to safely, ethically and effectively support people on a journey for healing. As a result, in 2020, we opened registration for the Psychedelic Practitioner Training, a 12-month professional certification program that offers current leading-edge thinking and modalities associated with guiding clients through safe and ethical psychedelic journeys. The inaugural cohort began training in April 2021.

With the FDA designating psychedelic therapy a “breakthrough therapy,” and thereby helping to speed up the process of researching and approving it to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a new era is now upon us—one in which psychiatrists will be able to legally prescribe psychedelics in the United States.

Deeply rooted in a vision that everyone should have access to mental health and well-being, Synthesis is uniquely poised to usher in this new era, pioneering as a global leader in advancing research, convening community, educating the public and engaging in activism to promote safe and legal access to psychedelics.

The Synthesis Institute is based in Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with the Digital Education division based in Oregon in the United States. We are accepting candidates globally and will consider candidates willing and able to work remotely.

You are the keeper of technical feasibility when it comes to maximizing the value of our product and solutions for them. Moreover, you are the designer and creator of the actual solution as well! You will be spending your days switching between your client-facing tasks and writing code to create & implement our solutions. Heuristics, optimisation, machine learning, time series analysis - whatever the problem necessitates, you have the perfect solution.
What you’ll be doing

Translate client information (qualitative and quantitative data) into a (re)configuration of our AI solutions to achieve optimal business value.

Translate client requirements into (new) solution designs.

Build & improve algorithms - leverage all that’s new in the fields of OR, ML, Data Science, AI, etc. to exceed the clients’ expectations.

Build integrations - ensure all relevant input data is extracted from the appropriate (clients’) sources & the solution is pushed into the right systems.

Explain the solutions to clients & prospects and convey their added value.

Assist the Account Executives with pre-sales where you will join sales meetings and tailor standard demos to showcase the value of our product and solutions.

To our customers, you will be the technical reference and you will implement our products and solutions to meet client requirements together with the Solution Consultant and development team.

Lead and deliver data exercises and proofs of value to a wide variety of international customers.

Be the communication partner of the technical staff of customers and clients.

What you’ll bring to the team
You are a fantastic communicator and you are keen on solving complex technical puzzles while keeping the client in mind at all times. You also have a knack for getting stakeholders and clients on the same page in pre-sales and implementing our solutions/product. Other than that, there are also some other requirements:

0 - 5 years of experience.

Master degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research or similar to the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) field.

Experience with Python and practical software development.

Not afraid to take responsibility.

Able to switch between coding and client management.

Ability to excel in teamwork as well as independently.

A ""let's get the job done"" mentality.

Affinity with the technical market and not afraid to dive into new technical subjects to make them ‘your own.

The WOW-factor

You speak other European languages than English.

There is a small tech-geek that lives inside of you.

Experience with JavaScript.

A vision on the position of AI within workforce management.

What is in it for you?
We promote and encourage a healthy lifestyle with flexible work hours, the latest tools, enhanced vacation allowance, gym membership contribution and virtual yoga classes.
Life at Quinyx

We are an innovative, agile and continuously growing modern tech company on a path to improve the work lives of millions around the world.

We develop workforce management solutions - a software that makes scheduling and time reporting more smooth and flexible for half a million users across the world.
Are you curious and ready to take the first steps on an awesome journey and make magic happen with us? As a member of the Quinyx family, you will be part of an inclusive and diverse workplace, where you are allowed to be yourself and thrive.
Our workforce optimization algorithms build the best schedules ever made, focusing on improving employee happiness, labour law compliance and customer experience. We are growing fast and looking for more colleagues who want to take over the world with autonomous decision-making.
About the role
As an AI Technical Consultant, you will be the main communication point for clients when it comes down to the technical aspects of the project. You are the keeper of technical feasibility when it comes to maximizing the value of our product and solutions for them. Moreover, you are the designer and creator of the actual solution as well! You will be spending your days switching between your client-facing tasks and writing code to create & implement our solutions. Heuristics, optimisation, machine learning, time series analysis - whatever the problem necessitates, you have the perfect solution.
What you’ll be doing

Translate client information (qualitative and quantitative data) into a (re)configuration of our AI solutions to achieve optimal business value.

Translate client requirements into (new) solution designs.

Build & improve algorithms - leverage all that’s new in the fields of OR, ML, Data Science, AI, etc. to exceed the clients’ expectations.

Build integrations - ensure all relevant input data is extracted from the appropriate (clients’) sources & the solution is pushed into the right systems.

Explain the solutions to clients & prospects and convey their added value.

Assist the Account Executives with pre-sales where you will join sales meetings and tailor standard demos to showcase the value of our product and solutions.

To our customers, you will be the technical reference and you will implement our products and solutions to meet client requirements together with the Solution Consultant and development team.

Lead and deliver data exercises and proofs of value to a wide variety of international customers.

Be the communication partner of the technical staff of customers and clients.

What you’ll bring to the team
You are a fantastic communicator and you are keen on solving complex technical puzzles while keeping the client in mind at all times. You also have a knack for getting stakeholders and clients on the same page in pre-sales and implementing our solutions/product. Other than that, there are also some other requirements:

0 - 5 years of experience.

Master degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research or similar to the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) field.

Experience with Python and practical software development.

Not afraid to take responsibility.

Able to switch between coding and client management.

Ability to excel in teamwork as well as independently.

A ""let's get the job done"" mentality.

Affinity with the technical market and not afraid to dive into new technical subjects to make them ‘your own.

The WOW-factor

You speak other European languages than English.

There is a small tech-geek that lives inside of you.

Experience with JavaScript.

A vision on the position of AI within workforce management.

Nomura overview
Nomura is an Asia-headquartered financial services group with an integrated global network spanning over 30 countries. By ‘Connecting Markets East & West’, Nomura services the needs of individuals, institutions, corporates and governments through its three business divisions: Retail, Asset Management, and Wholesale (Global Markets and Investment Banking). Founded in 1925, the firm is built on a tradition of disciplined entrepreneurship, serving clients with creative solutions and considered thought leadership.

Investment Banking overview:
Nomura’s Investment Banking Division provides advisory and capital-raising solutions to corporations, financial institutions, governments and public-sector organizations around the world. Our global teams act as geographic, product and industry specialists. We connect clients directly to Asia, accessing deep pools of liquidity and dynamic growth markets.
In EMEA, we operate across targeted industry sectors and in most major European countries to deliver strategic advice to clients wishing to acquire, combine or sell businesses or looking for financing and risk management solutions.

Programme overview:
Internships are a great opportunity to experience first-hand the possibilities of a career in banking. It is your chance to get a feel for our culture, create new networks and gain valuable on-the-job training. Internships are also the perfect preparation for a subsequent full time role. Nomura will extend full time offers to strong performers.

What’s your role?
Investment Banking interns can be placed in the Benelux coverage team.

Nomura’s Benelux coverage team capitalizes on a longstanding track-record of successfully executed M&A transactions, leveraging on a dedicated team with significant IB expertise based in Amsterdam. The team works in strict cooperation with other Nomura’s teams who provide country and industry expertise on an opportunistic basis, supporting local team from the origination to the execution phase. The Benelux coverage team also works alongside other Nomura’s product teams to address client needs with a full IB proposition. As part of this team, the intern will support more senior colleagues on the preparation of process documentation, valuation analysis and preparation of M&A pitches and get first hand exposure to origination and execution projects with a rapidly increasing level of responsibility.

What are we looking for?
At Nomura our goal is to attract and develop exceptionally talented people who share our passion for individual excellence and our commitment to teamwork. We recruit graduates and interns with a high level of academic and extra-curricular achievement, who will be able to withstand the rigours of a rapidly changing, demanding but ultimately rewarding environment.
Fluency in Dutch and English is essential.

ING’s global Model Validation IRRBB (“Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”) chapter is an energetic, diverse and collaborative international team consisting of about 15 highly qualified professionals of various quantitative backgrounds, located in Amsterdam.
Following ING’s Think Forward Strategy to become the next generation digital bank, data and models are considered key assets in our bank. As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

The role of model validator
As a model validator you focus on and further learn about the topics related to the models in your scope, using econometrics, quantitative finance, coding, business knowledge and related regulations. You perform in-depth analyses and write code to perform quantitative assessments. You summarize your analyses and conclusions in clear, fact-based and persuasively written reports, which are presented to the relevant Model Approval Committee. You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Your prospective model scope is broad and are related to the following main areas:
Behavioral: Modelling of mortgage & other loan prepayments and non-maturity deposits, as well as other embedded options in retail and wholesale products.
Interest rate: Market models (e.g. Hull-White model).
Valuation: Models used for calculating the economic value of a loan or deposit portfolio with embedded options.
Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.
Risk measurement: Models used for risk management and reporting (NPVaR, RRaR, NIIaR).
As part of the IRRBB chapter, you will contribute to further building and developing the team by sharing knowledge, coaching more junior staff and by embracing ING’s Agile way of working.
Who are we looking for
We are looking for enthusiastic colleagues who enjoy performing quantitative analyses, writing & defending high quality validation reports, and have an intrinsic curiosity to continuously expand their knowledge. In particular, as a member of our team, you have:

Above all, you have a genuine passion to continuously improve yourself and our team. As a model validator at ING, you will be empowered to have a true impact on ING’s future model landscape. Moreover, you will contribute to further implementing ING’s innovative Think Forward strategy.
Your work environment
The IRRBB Model Validation chapter is part of ING’s global Model Risk Management domain, which consists of multiple Model Validation teams (i.e. “chapters”, each focusing on a main risk area(s)) and Model Risk Oversight, located both in Amsterdam and Poland.
The domain has adopted and will further progress with the ING One Way of Working. In our organisational set-up, we distinguish tribes, chapters and squads.
Our main stakeholders are within ING’s head office and local risk management departments worldwide, senior management (including the CRO, his management team, the Executive Board and local CROs), internal and external auditors, the ECB and other regulators. To ensure its independence and effective challenge, Model Risk Management reports directly to the CRO.

ING’s global Model Validation IRRBB (“Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book”) chapter is an energetic, diverse and collaborative international team consisting of about 15 highly qualified professionals of various quantitative backgrounds, located in Amsterdam.
Following ING’s Think Forward Strategy to become the next generation digital bank, data and models are considered key assets in our bank. As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

You summarize your analyses and conclusions in clear, fact-based and persuasively written reports, which are presented to the relevant Model Approval Committee. You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Your prospective model scope is broad and are related to the following main areas:
Behavioral: Modelling of mortgage & other loan prepayments and non-maturity deposits, as well as other embedded options in retail and wholesale products.

Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.

Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.
At Farm21 we operate in a small team, enabling us to develop new ideas quickly and innovate where we can. Our platform is the core of our company, making developers indispensable. Development of new features improves continuously due to our Agile way of working. Our developers are directly in contact with users and research partners, working together to achieve the main goal of feeding the world in 2050.
We’re reinventing our industry. We recently launched our solution which is spreading like wildfire. Sales has doubled our expectations. The farming industry is yearning for our products.
‍
This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.
At Farm21 we operate in a small team, enabling us to develop new ideas quickly and innovate where we can. Our platform is the core of our company, making developers indispensable. Development of new features improves continuously due to our Agile way of working. Our developers are directly in contact with users and research partners, working together to achieve the main goal of feeding the world in 2050.
We’re reinventing our industry. We recently launched our solution which is spreading like wildfire. Sales has doubled our expectations. The farming industry is yearning for our products.

This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.

This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).

You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.
You can find yourself working in the Farm21 environment described above.",-1,-1,https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=b19d78247084afff&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=1d8d26b0b498ebe2&assa=8622,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=7e9ad2186f71aad0&fccid=c68355f498b83335&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-04-13,en,No,Yes,agriculture and industry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,A,0.2215868477483917,0.7784131522516083,0.49320943531093636,0.5060757684060043,Male,Mixed Age

He already passed HSK 1, 2, 3 and 4. But he needs to refresh it and then his goal is to eventually obtain HSK 5. Writing with a pen is not important, but to learn to select the right characters via pinyin is relevant. Of course his vocal skills and listening ability are top priority. Jeroen wants to improve his Chinese, so he can better talk directly with Chinese factory bosses while visiting China. This will help him more easily build a meaningful partnership with them to improve mutual understanding and eventually to help grow his business.In order to cultivate a Chinese learning environment the more Chinese talk the better. So from this perspective Jeroen is also interested in getting Chinese cooking classes in Chinese.You don't need to have a teaching or cooking education for this job.

Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Mozambique

From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam

When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February – April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.
Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background

Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information

While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).
Wona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment

In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Côte d'Ivoire

From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam

When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February –April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.
Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background

Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information
While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

In this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Côte d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.
Inades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Côte d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Côte d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Côte d'Ivoire?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment

In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!

Doesn’t it seem odd that we’ve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.

We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.

Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)

It’s with this mindset that we’ve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Every few weeks, a group of around 20 people of different nationalities and backgrounds - most of them not related to programming in any way - start their 11-week journey to becoming junior developers.

Some are looking to learn new skills and get a better job or a promotion, some are fresh out of school and decided they don’t want to follow a career in their field of study, but instead in software development, and others (the majority, actually) are looking to make a sometimes radical career change.

And they need you to guide them by:

Teaching, preparing, and improving classroom lectures for your students;
Evaluating students on homework assignments, mentoring them, and - if necessary - selecting them out of the program;
Developing software to support, automate, and improve the learning and teaching environments, using the same technologies you teach to your students.

We strongly believe that teachers should also be developers in their daily lives. That’s why this job includes both teaching and software development on our custom-built teaching and learning environment.

It’s also why prior experience in education, while obviously welcome, is not necessary, we can train you on the job.

And here’s what else we can offer you:

An inspiring environment where we prioritize adaptability, diversity, and lifelong learning;
Flexible schedules and work from home options;

We strive to do this without the use of experimental animals.

You go above and beyond for others, genuine and willing to help, always. You support the team around you, you don’t point fingers or pass blame. You take responsibility for your actions, are open, and respect others. You value different perspectives, in how you work and how you learn. You are naturally inquisitive, like to create and be creative. You are a problem solver, curious and resourceful, self-driven and constantly improving. You roll up your sleeves and dig in. You are excited by not knowing what may lie ahead. You are willing to take risks, try new things, even fail just to do it better next time. You’re not a jerk. You put people first. You are a good person, someone who just wants to do the right thing.

We are now fully committed to rapid growth and international expansion, supported by a recent €5 mln Series A investment. This makes it the perfect time to step in. The new Marketing Strategist has the opportunity to work in a dynamic and entrepreneurial environment, where he/she plays a central role in achieving ambitious growth.

A word on diversity: at Lepaya, all we’re askin’ is a little respect! To us, it doesn’t matter where you were born, what you believe in, how old you are, what you look like, or who you love. We believe that different perspectives and backgrounds will actually lift Lepaya to new heights and increase our power of thinking. Our passion is to build a strong culture with respect for each other’s unique experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and skills. Join us, as there is a place for you here!

660,marketing manager,Indeed,p_20d50803dca83da5,Head of Marketing,Getir, Amsterdam,"We're Getir, the pioneers of super-fast delivery. Our story can be divided into three elements: building an awesome people organization that drives this epic machine, making 10-minute grocery delivery possible by figuring out all of its intricacies, and scaling that business by getting people to embrace us.
The story of Getir dates back six years, when it first launched in Istanbul. After becoming the clear-cut market leader in our first market, we decided the global push was the next step. We recently launched in London, and have already set our eyes on Amsterdam and the Randstad region as well.
Innovative marketing, complemented with data-driven growth mechanisms is not just a necessity for winning. It's our style. You should see how excited our founding team gets when the topic of marketing comes up. Our modus operandi is ‘always be growing'.
While we have amassed numerous marketing best practices throughout our years, we also recognize that unique markets merit unique marketing strategies. We're in the Randstad region both to bring our own techniques, but also to adapt and learn new ways that result in winning. Localising our brand and our marketing strategies while also maintaining that unique Getir element - fast, somewhat quirky, experience-driven - is incredibly important for us.
With this collective push into international expansion, the story of Getir enters its second chapter. A chapter in which we're looking for a seasoned Head of Marketing who will bring their skills, experience, and humanity to join us in the Dutch chapter of this adventure.
Disclaimer: this position isn't a light or easy position. We're looking for someone with extensive experience both in Marketing in The Netherlands and in overcoming business challenges.

What You'll Do At Getir
Establish an awesome team. Lead and develop people in your team, quickly establishing a world-class Marketing Team that will bring about a resounding success in the Dutch market.
Develop and execute upon a city-specific strategy to adapt the Getir brand to the awesome people of Amsterdam and the Randstad region.
Manage our mediums, both external and internal. The app may be digital but marketing isn't limited to digital. We use ATL (TV, radio), BTL (outdoor), and more. Furthermore, our app is also our own medium, offering interesting possibilities for communication and partnerships.
Design and run campaigns, relentlessly. Optimise and re-run. Recruit and manage local agencies, and get the best out of the relationship.Collaborate with our FMCG partners to develop bespoke campaigns.
Collaborate directly both with the Chief Expansion Officer, Country GM, as well as the company's Founders in the decision-making process for successful local marketing. Simply put, these people are looking for someone to challenge and convince them to do things differently for even better results.
Apart from Marketing, as one of the leaders within the team, voice your opinion regarding other matters related to the organization and the business. Especially be active in growth-related matters. Be at the table. Disagree when necessary. Support when necessary.
Find that perfect balance between understanding the customer and fulfilling their desires, while also surprising them with delightful experiences they didn't even know they needed yet.
Beyond long-term strategies, always be ready to leverage opportunities in marketing and communications. Speed is our currency here at Getir. We decide quickly, often launching marketing campaigns in a fraction of the time compared to other, bigger organisations. Be ready to push the envelope and experience speed and urgency that you're unlikely to have seen anywhere else.
Challenge both yourself, and the organization you'll be a part of, as you face certain challenges throughout your career at Getir. We're not a perfect organization, but we'll always be honest and genuine as we strive to do the right thing.
What Getir Expects
You should have built and scaled consumer brands, ideally to millions of avid users in The Netherlands.
Extensive experience with dynamic campaign management, knowing when to pull which levers for whatever that moment's target may be.
Life and career-related insights into the Randstad region and the awesome nation of The Netherlands, including its people, its cultures and what form of communication people respond to. Know these like the back of your hand.
An extensive network within the marketing industry. The less intermediaries we need to get something done, the better. A solid network with agencies with an eye for brand communication is ideal.
A bias towards action. If possible, get it done. If not, reasonably push the subjective and imaginary boundaries to make it possible.
Excellent negotiation skills, especially considering we'll do significant media buying to push the brand.
Hands-on experience with digital marketing, especially performance marketing.
Work both with creative agencies, but also with the production companies that turn strategy into media content. We're pretty hands on.
Keep the pulse of your users. Always maintain a ROI-mindset.
Have fun while doing all of this. Work should ultimately be fun.",-1,-1,-1,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=20d50803dca83da5&fccid=f6020f6a5814878d&vjs=3,23 dagen geleden,23 dagen geleden,2021-04-03,en,No,No,commercial services,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,G,0.43134535367545074,0.5686546463245492,0.340940612785273,0.6591854747194553,Mixed Gender,Mixed Age

Extensive experience with dynamic campaign management, knowing when to pull which levers for whatever that moment's target may be.

666,marketing manager,Indeed,p_64e4c9af46646326,Head of Marketing,Getir, Amsterdam,"We're Getir, the pioneers of super-fast delivery. Our story can be divided into three elements: building an awesome people organization that drives this epic machine, making 10-minute grocery delivery possible by figuring out all of its intricacies, and scaling that business by getting people to embrace us.
The story of Getir dates back six years, when it first launched in Istanbul. After becoming the clear-cut market leader in our first market, we decided the global push was the next step. We recently launched in London, and have already set our eyes on Amsterdam and the Randstad region as well.
Innovative marketing, complemented with data-driven growth mechanisms is not just a necessity for winning. It's our style. You should see how excited our founding team gets when the topic of marketing comes up. Our modus operandi is ‘always be growing'.
While we have amassed numerous marketing best practices throughout our years, we also recognize that unique markets merit unique marketing strategies. We're in the Randstad region both to bring our own techniques, but also to adapt and learn new ways that result in winning. Localising our brand and our marketing strategies while also maintaining that unique Getir element - fast, somewhat quirky, experience-driven - is incredibly important for us.
With this collective push into international expansion, the story of Getir enters its second chapter. A chapter in which we're looking for a seasoned Head of Marketing who will bring their skills, experience, and humanity to join us in the Dutch chapter of this adventure.
Disclaimer: this position isn't a light or easy position. We're looking for someone with extensive experience both in Marketing in The Netherlands and in overcoming business challenges.

What You'll Do At Getir
Establish an awesome team. Lead and develop people in your team, quickly establishing a world-class Marketing Team that will bring about a resounding success in the Dutch market.
Develop and execute upon a city-specific strategy to adapt the Getir brand to the awesome people of Amsterdam and the Randstad region.
Manage our mediums, both external and internal. The app may be digital but marketing isn't limited to digital. We use ATL (TV, radio), BTL (outdoor), and more. Furthermore, our app is also our own medium, offering interesting possibilities for communication and partnerships.
Design and run campaigns, relentlessly. Optimise and re-run. Recruit and manage local agencies, and get the best out of the relationship.Collaborate with our FMCG partners to develop bespoke campaigns.
Collaborate directly both with the Chief Expansion Officer, Country GM, as well as the company's Founders in the decision-making process for successful local marketing. Simply put, these people are looking for someone to challenge and convince them to do things differently for even better results.
Apart from Marketing, as one of the leaders within the team, voice your opinion regarding other matters related to the organization and the business. Especially be active in growth-related matters. Be at the table. Disagree when necessary. Support when necessary.
Find that perfect balance between understanding the customer and fulfilling their desires, while also surprising them with delightful experiences they didn't even know they needed yet.
Beyond long-term strategies, always be ready to leverage opportunities in marketing and communications. Speed is our currency here at Getir. We decide quickly, often launching marketing campaigns in a fraction of the time compared to other, bigger organisations. Be ready to push the envelope and experience speed and urgency that you're unlikely to have seen anywhere else.
Challenge both yourself, and the organization you'll be a part of, as you face certain challenges throughout your career at Getir. We're not a perfect organization, but we'll always be honest and genuine as we strive to do the right thing.

672,marketing manager,Indeed,p_0f3ce9edbb267930,Head of Marketing,Getir, Amsterdam,"We're Getir, the pioneers of super-fast delivery. Our story can be divided into three elements: building an awesome people organization that drives this epic machine, making 10-minute grocery delivery possible by figuring out all of its intricacies, and scaling that business by getting people to embrace us.
The story of Getir dates back six years, when it first launched in Istanbul. After becoming the clear-cut market leader in our first market, we decided the global push was the next step. We recently launched in London, and have already set our eyes on Amsterdam and the Randstad region as well.
Innovative marketing, complemented with data-driven growth mechanisms is not just a necessity for winning. It's our style. You should see how excited our founding team gets when the topic of marketing comes up. Our modus operandi is ‘always be growing'.
While we have amassed numerous marketing best practices throughout our years, we also recognize that unique markets merit unique marketing strategies. We're in the Randstad region both to bring our own techniques, but also to adapt and learn new ways that result in winning. Localising our brand and our marketing strategies while also maintaining that unique Getir element - fast, somewhat quirky, experience-driven - is incredibly important for us.
With this collective push into international expansion, the story of Getir enters its second chapter. A chapter in which we're looking for a seasoned Head of Marketing who will bring their skills, experience, and humanity to join us in the Dutch chapter of this adventure.
Disclaimer: this position isn't a light or easy position. We're looking for someone with extensive experience both in Marketing in The Netherlands and in overcoming business challenges.

What You'll Do At Getir
Establish an awesome team. Lead and develop people in your team, quickly establishing a world-class Marketing Team that will bring about a resounding success in the Dutch market.
Develop and execute upon a city-specific strategy to adapt the Getir brand to the awesome people of Amsterdam and the Randstad region.
Manage our mediums, both external and internal. The app may be digital but marketing isn't limited to digital. We use ATL (TV, radio), BTL (outdoor), and more. Furthermore, our app is also our own medium, offering interesting possibilities for communication and partnerships.
Design and run campaigns, relentlessly. Optimise and re-run. Recruit and manage local agencies, and get the best out of the relationship.Collaborate with our FMCG partners to develop bespoke campaigns.
Collaborate directly both with the Chief Expansion Officer, Country GM, as well as the company's Founders in the decision-making process for successful local marketing. Simply put, these people are looking for someone to challenge and convince them to do things differently for even better results.
Apart from Marketing, as one of the leaders within the team, voice your opinion regarding other matters related to the organization and the business. Especially be active in growth-related matters. Be at the table. Disagree when necessary. Support when necessary.
Find that perfect balance between understanding the customer and fulfilling their desires, while also surprising them with delightful experiences they didn't even know they needed yet.
Beyond long-term strategies, always be ready to leverage opportunities in marketing and communications. Speed is our currency here at Getir. We decide quickly, often launching marketing campaigns in a fraction of the time compared to other, bigger organisations. Be ready to push the envelope and experience speed and urgency that you're unlikely to have seen anywhere else.
Challenge both yourself, and the organization you'll be a part of, as you face certain challenges throughout your career at Getir. We're not a perfect organization, but we'll always be honest and genuine as we strive to do the right thing.
What Getir Expects
You should have built and scaled consumer brands, ideally to millions of avid users in The Netherlands.
Extensive experience with dynamic campaign management, knowing when to pull which levers for whatever that moment's target may be.
Life and career-related insights into the Randstad region and the awesome nation of The Netherlands, including its people, its cultures and what form of communication people respond to. Know these like the back of your hand.
An extensive network within the marketing industry. The less intermediaries we need to get something done, the better. A solid network with agencies with an eye for brand communication is ideal.
A bias towards action. If possible, get it done. If not, reasonably push the subjective and imaginary boundaries to make it possible.
Excellent negotiation skills, especially considering we'll do significant media buying to push the brand.

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the unique artwork - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 international offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 international offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the unique artwork - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 international offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

Lead or facilitate given trainings, following your recommendation around the format to follow for each
Design & continuously improve a monthly onboarding programme for our new joiners, embedded within the HR onboarding programme. This programme could include a 'Manager's onboarding guide', a defined curriculum of introductory trainings, an onboarding tool (eg. Qollab) for improved engagement - amongst others.

Design & continuously improve programmes targeted to our sellers: includes an onboarding programme for our new sellers (one for all sellers, with further add-ons for our assigned sellers) as well as refreshers, webinars and recorded sessions for existing sellers. Aim is to promote engagement as well as guarantee the growth of submissions of quality supply
Design & continuously improve programmes targeted to the extended commercial teams: Marketing & CX
Maintain & continuously improve our knowledge database, ensuring it always reflects documentation around all commercial tools & processes
Proactively identify areas of opportunity for operational trainings or skill-based trainings, designing programmes, putting pilots in place & executing post rollout
Always think one step further, embedding first-class training frameworks & methodologies into our own trainings to drive engagement & memorisation of the content

Energy, quality driven and a sense of urgency with everything you touch;
You are hands-on: able and willing to execute yourself
You are eager and quick to learn sometimes complex topics and able to effectively put new knowledge into practice

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the unique artwork - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 international offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the unique artwork - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone. In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 international offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.
