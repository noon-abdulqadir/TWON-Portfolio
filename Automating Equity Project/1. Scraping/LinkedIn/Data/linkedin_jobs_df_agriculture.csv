A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

The special object you've been searching for, or a new and unexpected interest you never thought you'd have: the more you look, the more you'll find. And at Catawiki, there's always more to the story. Our experts value, authenticate and curate everything from automobiles to vintage stamps, so everything you encounter is real and layered with meaning - waiting to be found.

Our mission is to connect passionate enthusiasts with the objects that tell their stories. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, we help over 10 million people discover new treasures every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent! Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 and have since grown to over 650 Catawikians, working across 7 international offices, while maintaining our start-up mentality every step of the way.

Work with the Recruitment, Marketing & Comms Teams to refine Catawiki's EVP
Help create awareness about Catawiki's EVP by creating and sharing relevant content across our different careers channels (Linkedin, Careers Website, Twitter, Youtube etc)
Create Catawiki's employer branding content calendar and schedule
Create engaging content across different mediums (Photo, Video, Podcast, Blogpost etc) and experiment with different ideas, using data to see what works best.
Develop internal engagement activities to help all Catawikians become brand ambassadors.
Rebuild and maintain the Catawiki ""Jobs Website"" to bring it more in line with the company and culture we represent today.

Who you are

3-5 years Marketing experience in fast paced environments combined with demonstrable experience in building out an attractive Employer Brand for a fast growing business
Experience setting up inspiring and effective digital marketing campaigns
Experience with creating engaging employer content across different channels
A data driven mindset
A strong understanding of the recruitment world including how the startup / scale-up ecosystem in the Netherlands and Europe works
Experience with project and budget management
Excellent written and verbal English communication skills
Experience in corporate communications

Here's what we can offer you
A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You'll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.
Opportunities for personal and professional growth.

business support,Indeed,p_2132099a243e9335,Customer Support Specialist,Synthesis Retreat, Amsterdam,"Since 2018, The Synthesis Institute has been offering legal, medically-supervised and science-based psychedelic wellness retreats near Amsterdam for open-minded individuals who want to experience psychedelics for integrative healing and expansion potential.

Standing on years of experience and a reputation for offering world-class psychedelic retreats, Synthesis is uniquely qualified to set the standard for practitioners to safely, ethically and effectively support people on a journey for healing. As a result, in 2020, we opened registration for the Psychedelic Practitioner Training, a 12-month professional certification program that offers current leading-edge thinking and modalities associated with guiding clients through safe and ethical psychedelic journeys. The inaugural cohort began training in April 2021.

With the FDA designating psychedelic therapy a “breakthrough therapy,” and thereby helping to speed up the process of researching and approving it to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a new era is now upon us—one in which psychiatrists will be able to legally prescribe psychedelics in the United States.

Deeply rooted in a vision that everyone should have access to mental health and well-being, Synthesis is uniquely poised to usher in this new era, pioneering as a global leader in advancing research, convening community, educating the public and engaging in activism to promote safe and legal access to psychedelics.

The Synthesis Institute is based in Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with the Digital Education division based in Oregon in the United States. We are accepting candidates globally and will consider candidates willing and able to work remotely.

business support,Indeed,p_f4261c14a911741a,Customer Support Specialist,Synthesis Retreat, Amsterdam,"Since 2018, The Synthesis Institute has been offering legal, medically-supervised and science-based psychedelic wellness retreats near Amsterdam for open-minded individuals who want to experience psychedelics for integrative healing and expansion potential.

Standing on years of experience and a reputation for offering world-class psychedelic retreats, Synthesis is uniquely qualified to set the standard for practitioners to safely, ethically and effectively support people on a journey for healing. As a result, in 2020, we opened registration for the Psychedelic Practitioner Training, a 12-month professional certification program that offers current leading-edge thinking and modalities associated with guiding clients through safe and ethical psychedelic journeys. The inaugural cohort began training in April 2021.

With the FDA designating psychedelic therapy a “breakthrough therapy,” and thereby helping to speed up the process of researching and approving it to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a new era is now upon us—one in which psychiatrists will be able to legally prescribe psychedelics in the United States.

Deeply rooted in a vision that everyone should have access to mental health and well-being, Synthesis is uniquely poised to usher in this new era, pioneering as a global leader in advancing research, convening community, educating the public and engaging in activism to promote safe and legal access to psychedelics.

The Synthesis Institute is based in Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with the Digital Education division based in Oregon in the United States. We are accepting candidates globally and will consider candidates willing and able to work remotely.

About the role
As an AI Technical Consultant, you will be the main communication point for clients when it comes down to the technical aspects of the project.

Following ING’s Think Forward Strategy to become the next generation digital bank, data and models are considered key assets in our bank. As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.

To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Your prospective model scope is broad and are related to the following main areas:
Behavioral: Modelling of mortgage & other loan prepayments and non-maturity deposits, as well as other embedded options in retail and wholesale products.

Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.
Risk measurement: Models used for risk management and reporting (NPVaR, RRaR, NIIaR).
As part of the IRRBB chapter, you will contribute to further building and developing the team by sharing knowledge, coaching more junior staff and by embracing ING’s Agile way of working.

agriculture,Indeed,p_b19d78247084afff,Full Stack Developer,Farm21, Amsterdam,"Working to help solve the global food crisis.
Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.
At Farm21 we operate in a small team, enabling us to develop new ideas quickly and innovate where we can. Our platform is the core of our company, making developers indispensable. Development of new features improves continuously due to our Agile way of working. Our developers are directly in contact with users and research partners, working together to achieve the main goal of feeding the world in 2050.
We’re reinventing our industry. We recently launched our solution which is spreading like wildfire. Sales has doubled our expectations. The farming industry is yearning for our products.
‍
This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.

We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.
At Farm21 we operate in a small team, enabling us to develop new ideas quickly and innovate where we can. Our platform is the core of our company, making developers indispensable. Development of new features improves continuously due to our Agile way of working. Our developers are directly in contact with users and research partners, working together to achieve the main goal of feeding the world in 2050.
We’re reinventing our industry. We recently launched our solution which is spreading like wildfire. Sales has doubled our expectations. The farming industry is yearning for our products.
‍
This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.
