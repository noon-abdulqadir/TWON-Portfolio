manager of healthcare institution,Indeed,p_961b1ff16bda18fd,Lead Planner,PALLAS, Alkmaar,"Alkmaar Fulltime
Who is PALLAS?
The Foundation Preparation Pallas-reactor (PALLAS) is designing and building a multifunctional reactor for the production of (medical) isotopes and for conducting nuclear technological research. This reactor will replace the current High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten (NL) to guarantee the security of supply for millions of patients worldwide.
PALLAS wants to build its future together with Foundation NRG (NRG). We both have the ambition to continue and enforce the Dutch position as a worldwide top producer of radiopharmaceuticals in Petten, 50km north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We are doing this with the realisation of the FIELD-LAB (a research facility for the development of new medicines), the new PALLAS-reactor and the Nuclear Health Centre (a new production facility for processing therapeutic isotopes). The diagnosis market remains a spearhead, but the focus will mainly be on innovations and expanding the production chain for therapeutic isotopes. Through the collaboration with various national and international university hospitals and knowledge institutions, Petten is to become a breeding ground in Europe for new nuclear medicine. This results in new treatments that can help implement customised patient therapy.

PALLAS aspires to become a high-reliability organisation with the skills and capability to deliver its mission and vision through its core values, whilst ensuring that its safety, security and quality objectives are always achieved. We apply our unique knowledge and experience to benefit society by taking an interest in our stakeholders.
PALLAS is composed of colleagues coming from all over the world, bringing together a unique set of knowledge and experience. Everyone in PALLAS is required to take personal responsibility for the safety of themselves and of anyone who is directly or indirectly affected by their actions. A high safety culture is continuously built by the organisation.

Who is PALLAS?
The Foundation Preparation Pallas-reactor (PALLAS) is designing and building a multifunctional reactor for the production of (medical) isotopes and for conducting nuclear technological research. This reactor will replace the current High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten (NL) to guarantee the security of supply for millions of patients worldwide.
PALLAS wants to build its future together with Foundation NRG (NRG). We both have the ambition to continue and enforce the Dutch position as a worldwide top producer of radiopharmaceuticals in Petten, 50km north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We are doing this with the realisation of the FIELD-LAB (a research facility for the development of new medicines), the new PALLAS-reactor and the Nuclear Health Centre (a new production facility for processing therapeutic isotopes). The diagnosis market remains a spearhead, but the focus will mainly be on innovations and expanding the production chain for therapeutic isotopes. Through the collaboration with various national and international university hospitals and knowledge institutions, Petten is to become a breeding ground in Europe for new nuclear medicine. This results in new treatments that can help implement customised patient therapy.

PALLAS aspires to become a high-reliability organisation with the skills and capability to deliver its mission and vision through its core values, whilst ensuring that its safety, security and quality objectives are always achieved. We apply our unique knowledge and experience to benefit society by taking an interest in our stakeholders.
PALLAS is composed of colleagues coming from all over the world, bringing together a unique set of knowledge and experience. Everyone in PALLAS is required to take personal responsibility for the safety of themselves and of anyone who is directly or indirectly affected by their actions. A high safety culture is continuously built by the organisation.

Who is PALLAS?
The Foundation Preparation Pallas-reactor (PALLAS) is designing and building a multifunctional reactor for the production of (medical) isotopes and for conducting nuclear technological research. This reactor will replace the current High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten (NL) to guarantee the security of supply for millions of patients worldwide.
PALLAS wants to build its future together with Foundation NRG (NRG). We both have the ambition to continue and enforce the Dutch position as a worldwide top producer of radiopharmaceuticals in Petten, 50km north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We are doing this with the realisation of the FIELD-LAB (a research facility for the development of new medicines), the new PALLAS-reactor and the Nuclear Health Centre (a new production facility for processing therapeutic isotopes). The diagnosis market remains a spearhead, but the focus will mainly be on innovations and expanding the production chain for therapeutic isotopes. Through the collaboration with various national and international university hospitals and knowledge institutions, Petten is to become a breeding ground in Europe for new nuclear medicine. This results in new treatments that can help implement customised patient therapy.

PALLAS aspires to become a high-reliability organisation with the skills and capability to deliver its mission and vision through its core values, whilst ensuring that its safety, security and quality objectives are always achieved.

manager of healthcare institution,Indeed,p_3b4389bc6aa8d1a7,Lead Planner,PALLAS, Alkmaar,"Alkmaar Fulltime
Who is PALLAS?
The Foundation Preparation Pallas-reactor (PALLAS) is designing and building a multifunctional reactor for the production of (medical) isotopes and for conducting nuclear technological research. This reactor will replace the current High Flux Reactor (HFR) in Petten (NL) to guarantee the security of supply for millions of patients worldwide.
PALLAS wants to build its future together with Foundation NRG (NRG). We both have the ambition to continue and enforce the Dutch position as a worldwide top producer of radiopharmaceuticals in Petten, 50km north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We are doing this with the realisation of the FIELD-LAB (a research facility for the development of new medicines), the new PALLAS-reactor and the Nuclear Health Centre (a new production facility for processing therapeutic isotopes). The diagnosis market remains a spearhead, but the focus will mainly be on innovations and expanding the production chain for therapeutic isotopes. Through the collaboration with various national and international university hospitals and knowledge institutions, Petten is to become a breeding ground in Europe for new nuclear medicine. This results in new treatments that can help implement customised patient therapy.

PALLAS aspires to become a high-reliability organisation with the skills and capability to deliver its mission and vision through its core values, whilst ensuring that its safety, security and quality objectives are always achieved. We apply our unique knowledge and experience to benefit society by taking an interest in our stakeholders.
PALLAS is composed of colleagues coming from all over the world, bringing together a unique set of knowledge and experience. Everyone in PALLAS is required to take personal responsibility for the safety of themselves and of anyone who is directly or indirectly affected by their actions. A high safety culture is continuously built by the organisation.

Despite what most movies and tv-shows would have you believe, financial trading is not just done in the United States. The financial market is a global market, and many developing countries are starting to play a bigger and bigger role. They’re called emerging or frontier markets and for smart investors, they can be a gold mine. All they need is the right tools.
Most banks, funds and financial institutions rely on big corporate IT consultancies to design, build, and maintain their systems. And rightfully so, because those consultancies employ a lot of IT specialists. Unfortunately, that’s not enough when it comes to emerging and frontier markets. In those markets, companies need a specialized partner that doesn’t just possess the technical expertise but can also provide the operational services required. This is where you come in.
What can I do?
As a Senior Mendix Developer you will become part of a team with one other Senior Developer. Together with the Development lead and two Junior Developers you will work to improve the platform, every single day. By working closely with your clients and getting a better understanding of what they need, you will add new features and functionality and look for constant improvement.
Sounds cool! What should I bring?
Other than some serious Mendix skills you mean? Not much. All you really need is solid Mendix experience and the desire to make a positive impact on developing countries around the globe. Sure, it’s great if you already have a background in the Fintech domain but your mindset is all they really care about.
Perfect, that’s me! But what about my wallet?
You’ll definitely be taken care off. For starters, you will receive a base salary up to €5500 gross a month based on 40 hours a week. Of course, it doesn’t stop there. On top of your base salary you will receive excellent secondary benefits including 25 holidays and a healthy pension. The best part? You’ll get to work in the beautiful city centre of Amsterdam while making a positive global impact. So what are you waiting for?

manager of healthcare institution,Indeed,p_5d25c29d3ba0e0a4,Mendix Developer,Search X Recruitment, Amsterdam,"Big banks, small funds, tiny asset managers. No matter the size, they all have the same problem. Getting reliable access to emerging and frontier markets. Investing across borders can be a tricky thing if you don’t have the right tools. That’s why they need your help to build them.
Tell me more…
Despite what most movies and tv-shows would have you believe, financial trading is not just done in the United States. The financial market is a global market, and many developing countries are starting to play a bigger and bigger role. They’re called emerging or frontier markets and for smart investors, they can be a gold mine. All they need is the right tools.
Most banks, funds and financial institutions rely on big corporate IT consultancies to design, build, and maintain their systems. And rightfully so, because those consultancies employ a lot of IT specialists. Unfortunately, that’s not enough when it comes to emerging and frontier markets. In those markets, companies need a specialized partner that doesn’t just possess the technical expertise but can also provide the operational services required. This is where you come in.
What can I do?
As a Senior Mendix Developer you will become part of a team with one other Senior Developer. Together with the Development lead and two Junior Developers you will work to improve the platform, every single day. By working closely with your clients and getting a better understanding of what they need, you will add new features and functionality and look for constant improvement.
Sounds cool! What should I bring?
Other than some serious Mendix skills you mean? Not much. All you really need is solid Mendix experience and the desire to make a positive impact on developing countries around the globe. Sure, it’s great if you already have a background in the Fintech domain but your mindset is all they really care about.
Perfect, that’s me! But what about my wallet?
You’ll definitely be taken care off. For starters, you will receive a base salary up to €5500 gross a month based on 40 hours a week. Of course, it doesn’t stop there. On top of your base salary you will receive excellent secondary benefits including 25 holidays and a healthy pension. The best part? You’ll get to work in the beautiful city centre of Amsterdam while making a positive global impact. So what are you waiting for?
