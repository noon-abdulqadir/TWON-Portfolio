At Regus, we’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work better, faster, happier. Join us in one of our Regus centre teams. Bring more freedom to more people and businesses. And you’ll be able to work better, faster and happier too.
The opportunity
As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers, solving problems for them and making sure they have everything they need.
A typical day at Regus
You arrive 15 minutes before your centre opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.
Customers start coming in thick and fast. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and take an order for drinks?
The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.
Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organisation of next week’s networking event. You plan and write the invites to customers, then create, print and put up posters on the noticeboards around the centre.
The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. Once the last person has left the building and everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.
About you
We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:
A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathise with people’s needs
Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
Positive, enthusiastic and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
Confident using MS Office and other basic IT packages
Fluent English & Dutch speaker
What we offer
On top of a competitive salary package you’ll enjoy:
A bright and inspiring work environment

At Regus, we’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work better, faster, happier. Join us in one of our Regus centre teams. Bring more freedom to more people and businesses. And you’ll be able to work better, faster and happier too.
The opportunity
As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers, solving problems for them and making sure they have everything they need.
A typical day at Regus
You arrive 15 minutes before your centre opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.
Customers start coming in thick and fast. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and take an order for drinks?
The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.
Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organisation of next week’s networking event. You plan and write the invites to customers, then create, print and put up posters on the noticeboards around the centre.
The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. Once the last person has left the building and everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.

Vacature beschrijving
Top-notch food service for all people at home! In other words; that delicious meal was delivered right on time and by a super friendly courier. That's your job! You are in control to make the delivery service of our couriers as smooth and fast as possible.

A courier with a flat tire? An incomplete order? Nothing is too crazy for you! You switch quickly, solve a problem in no time and ensure happy customers. Our customers in 11 countries know where to find us when they feel like a Mexican burger, falafel, or Indian curry.

A day in the life of the Operations Coordinator:
Your day starts in the afternoon because the peak of delivery is of course in the evening. When you sit at your computer, you can already see the first orders coming in. While you're creating the order summary, a courier reports to you with a problem. He has a flat tire! It is of course extremely important that the Surinamese roti is still warm and therefore delivered exactly on time! You have the map of the city in front of you on your laptop, so you know exactly which other courier you can use now. Meanwhile, three other deliverers also report to you, each with a different problem. This is exactly what gives you energy; switch quickly, set priorities, solve problems, and above all… make our customers happy with top-notch service!

Vacature beschrijving
Top-notch food service for all people at home! In other words; that delicious meal was delivered right on time and by a super friendly courier. That's your job! You are in control to make the delivery service of our couriers as smooth and fast as possible.

A courier with a flat tire? An incomplete order? Nothing is too crazy for you! You switch quickly, solve a problem in no time and ensure happy customers. Our customers in 11 countries know where to find us when they feel like a Mexican burger, falafel, or Indian curry.

A day in the life of the Operations Coordinator:
Your day starts in the afternoon because the peak of delivery is of course in the evening. When you sit at your computer, you can already see the first orders coming in. While you're creating the order summary, a courier reports to you with a problem. He has a flat tire! It is of course extremely important that the Surinamese roti is still warm and therefore delivered exactly on time! You have the map of the city in front of you on your laptop, so you know exactly which other courier you can use now. Meanwhile, three other deliverers also report to you, each with a different problem. This is exactly what gives you energy; switch quickly, set priorities, solve problems, and above all… make our customers happy with top-notch service!

Vacature beschrijving
Top-notch food service for all people at home! In other words; that delicious meal was delivered right on time and by a super friendly courier. That's your job! You are in control to make the delivery service of our couriers as smooth and fast as possible.

A courier with a flat tire? An incomplete order? Nothing is too crazy for you! You switch quickly, solve a problem in no time and ensure happy customers. Our customers in 11 countries know where to find us when they feel like a Mexican burger, falafel, or Indian curry.

A day in the life of the Operations Coordinator:
Your day starts in the afternoon because the peak of delivery is of course in the evening. When you sit at your computer, you can already see the first orders coming in. While you're creating the order summary, a courier reports to you with a problem. He has a flat tire! It is of course extremely important that the Surinamese roti is still warm and therefore delivered exactly on time! You have the map of the city in front of you on your laptop, so you know exactly which other courier you can use now. Meanwhile, three other deliverers also report to you, each with a different problem. This is exactly what gives you energy; switch quickly, set priorities, solve problems, and above all… make our customers happy with top-notch service!

As a Live Operations Coordinator, you are part of the Customer Service team - and the following activities are the core tasks of your position:

You are the central figure in terms of operational support to all deliverers;
You help deliverers with all kinds of problems, with the aim of delivering all meals to the end customer exactly on time and with a smile;
You plan the rides of the deliverers and keep an overview of all deliverers in the city;
You maintain contact with the delivery staff (and sometimes with the restaurants) via chat, e-mail, and also by telephone.
All onboarding activities take place in the office. During the current situation, you work from home. If the measures surrounding corona become more flexible, you will increasingly work in the office.
