difference You will be immersed in a which is delivered via and numerous  We focus also on the which will prove immensely valuable when you go on to and further your career, , Founded in 2002, our Foundation has worked to establish sustainable practices throughout the Amazon True sustainability encompasses all areas of life in the rainforest people, plants and wildlife We take a which values  we look at real issues faced by local people and try to develop practical, sustainable alternatives We envision a sustainable Amazon where education and learning is the forefront for driving understanding and change The Amazon is under constant threat from many processes that cause habitat destruction such as logging, agriculture and mining Our sustainable initiative projects provide alternative forms of income that can help protect the rainforest as well as give people a livelihood This means that we help protect one of the most biodiverse places in the world, preventing the extinction of species, and other associated effects of rainforest destruction, such as climate change, , All our projects focus on two main areas which focuses directly on the rainforest, and where we work with local Communities The Manu Biosphere is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, with millions of species awaiting study, and numerous local communities living nearby, , In Manu we have a great opportunity to study conservation and biodiversity issues on micro and macro scales from endemic species of frogs that are not found anywhere else to a larger ecosystem approach By studying animal distribution and ecology on our reserve, looking at where they can be found, at what times and what weather conditions, we can begin to understand the relationship between the forest and the wildlife The people that live in Manu face issues of poverty, low education standards, malnutrition and lack of resources In trying to provide for their families, people can sometimes end up in dangerous, unsustainable jobs like slash and burn agriculture and illegal logging Our community projects were set up to investigate and provide alternative, safe, sustainable ways to earn their money and feed their families, , Research, , The Amazon is a delicately balanced ecosystem, however, human destruction of the rainforest is happening at such an alarming rate that these pristine environments are being systematically destroyed, , , , So what happens when a patch of destroyed rainforest is left alone, when the jungle is allowed to reclaim it and life slowly returns Our project is uniquely placed to investigate this, as for many years now our reserve has been naturally regenerating from when it was once farmland, , Our biodiversity monitoring plan is investigating the value of regenerating tropical rainforest for biodiversity and how species move back to forest that has a history of human disturbance This is the challenge we have set ourselves to answer through the Research Monitoring Programme, which is run in partnership with leading universities such as the University of Glasgow and Oxford University By developing longterm comparative studies we can understand how forests regenerate that have experienced different types and levels of disturbance We examine how the diversity of life can return if we promote and nurture successful rainforest regeneration As agricultural and industrial activities move into new areas to exploit, the biological value of regenerating forests is becoming increasingly important and our studies aim to investigate this, , Our scientific research programme has 3 main areas of focus, , As an intern, you will work alongside our field staff with the investigations that will answer these questions, , Mascotania Macaw monitoring programme, , The blueheaded macaw is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, meaning it is threatened with extinction The blueheaded macaw lives in a very specific habitat and so is heavily affected by deforestation and other human disturbances Their numbers are further damaged by exploitation for the pet trade, a growing problem in Peru, , So far we have found a decrease in the number of blueheaded macaws on the reserve over the past few years, correlating with an increase in tourist numbers Our aim is to successfully understand their behaviour and to educate tourists about responsible bird watching You will be involved in this by helping to monitor the number of blueheaded macaws visiting our clay lick at dawn as well as noting their activity, and recording the impacts of tourism on the birds, , Avian monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Bird species composition and diversity can signify many different things about the forest, such as forest type, structure, age, health, and level and type of human impact Hunting pressure and habitat fragmentation through roads and deforestation can largely affect bird populations For example, healthy populations of game birds such as guans, tinamous and trumpeters indicate low to zero hunting pressure, whilst the presence of a highly specialist species such as the harpy eagle may indicate undisturbed primary forest Not only is the ecology of many of these tropical foothill species poorly known, but the true value of regenerating forest for birds is understudied We conduct early morning transects along the reserve to listen and look for birds, , Butterfly monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , There are currently more than 550 known species of butterfly at the reserve Butterflies are significant bioindicators as well as pollinators for many plant species, which makes understanding their distribution throughout the forest, species density and fluctuations over time, a significant research project for us Butterfly larvae have highly specialised diets, so we can learn about the vegetation in each part of the forest by looking at the species we find in them, and by comparing our findings in each forest type we can see what effect regenerating forest has on species distribution, , You will be involved in setting up butterfly traps and bait, identifying them and recording new species to the reserve Butterflies teach us a lot about the forest and the changes that take place within it We are working on producing a comprehensive guide for visitors to the reserve, , Amphibian and reptile monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Amphibians are excellent indicator species as they are extremely vulnerable to changes in their environment They have very thin skin which they use for gas exchange, and this makes them very sensitive to chemical pollutants and also to changes in climate eg temperature and humidity This means that they are one of the most important bioindicator species on the reserve, but it also means they are incredibly vulnerable, and are threatened by human activity the world over Studying the way they use regenerating forest is therefore vital for assessing its conservation value, , Mammal monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , In order to understand the importance of regenerating rainforest for mammal species, we have used a series of camera traps set up around the reserve to capture images of mammals in all three forest types So far more than 40 large mammal species have been recorded at the MLC, including 13 individual jaguar Due to the elusive nature of many mammal species the rest of our research is more adhoc You may find yourself unexpectedly tracking puma prints for half an hour, or trying to frantically count the number of peccaries that just crossed your path These encounters are vital to our understanding of the way mammals use regenerating forest, , Sustainable Community Initiatives, , We work with local communities in Manu to create sustainable income that meets the challenges faced by remote rainforest towns Poverty and lack of access to higher education in Manu forces many families into unsustainable work such as illegal logging, slash and burn agriculture, and mining Not only are these often dangerous and unhealthy, with little financial return, they also contribute to rainforest destruction To date our community projects have positively impacted more than 600 people, , Biogardens, , We work specifically with local mothers to combat malnutrition, by providing resources and knowledge to build biogardens that produce nutritious, fresh food for families, and extra income through surplus crops So far volunteers and local mothers have created over 60 family biogardens, and have helped build two institutional biogardens Since beginning our work with biogardens in 2009, this has resulted in an annual increase in income for the direct beneficiaries of biogardens, and an increase in child nutrition and health, , Agroforestry, , The agroforestry plots are planted with local farmers, and provide both short and longterm income through producing sustainable wood with banana production This is an environmentally sustainable livelihood that provides a sustainable alternative to illegal logging activities in the surrounding forest Agroforestry encourages species diversity, increases soil nutrition, and creates carbon credits that can be sold to further support the project, , We have helped turn more than 61 hectares of abandoned and degraded land into agroforestry plots, which have subsequently seen increased biodiversity, help plant over 10,000 banana trees, 7,000 hardwood and softwood trees, and created the first program in Peru to ever commercialise carbon credits on behalf of a local community sold to Oriel College Oxford University, , all information above is subject to

like autonomous driving, the square kilometre array for radio astronomy, biomedical sensing systems, the internetofthings with millions of users and sensors, all generate enormous amounts of data and it is not always clear how to gather, process, and analyze that data in an efficient and rigorous manner Data science provides a solution to this problem It basically yields a set of tools for data mining, data cleansing, machine learning and data analysis, , While these tools can tackle a wide variety of problems, computer science approaches often ignore the structure that is present in the problem due to the physics This structure could come from the prior knowledge of the model that generates the data eg, radio frequency channel models, biomedical signal models, diffusion models, or it could directly relate to the structure in the data eg, spacetime, sparsity, networkgraph data Taking such structure into account will aid many of the existing data science tools, making them easier to interpret and simpler to implement This field of structured data science is shaped by the nontrivial interplay between conventional signal processing and conventional data science The goal is to illuminate and explore this interplay and apply it to the earlier mentioned applications, , , , The opening for an Assistant Professor is intended to further develop this area A background in

looking for an excellent PhD candidate to join a unique project focused on improving the state of machine learning for Earth Observation EO data This project is funded by a NWOENW Klein 1 Grant titled Physicsaware Spatiotemporal Machine Learning for Earth Observation Data by the Dutch Research Council The research is going to be primarily performed in the Automated Design of Algorithms ADA Research Group at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science LIACS and involves collaborations with researchers in the Institute of Environmental Sciences CML, and the European Space Agency ESAESRIN, the main organisation in charge of the collection of EO data in Europe, , During the past few years, the vision of creating the digital twin of Earth has been put forward to allow better decision support for addressing grand environmental challenges, such as global warming or nature conservation Such a digital twin could be realised through designing models that fully capture the complex nature of interacting environmental processes on Earth Using these models, we would be able to forecast and simulate the future state of the Earth before and after taking corrective actions, , , Earth Observation EO data has been collected from a variety of remote sensing equipment since the early 1980s, with the current load of terabytes per day that is openly accessible for building these models There are, in general, two approaches taken in the analysis of EO data On the one hand, there exists a group of widelyadopted theorydriven physical models eg, radiative transfer models Due to their illposed nature, these models are often inaccurate Although they do maintain the consistency according to the governing physical rules of the Earth system, their usability in extracting global models is limited due to their inaccuracy Datadriven models acquired by using machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, offer substantial benefits in improving the modelling accuracy by capturing patterns in the global EO data They may, however, lead to physicallyinconsistent results, , The complementary nature of the two modelling schemes motivates exploring their combination Aiming for designing comprehensive models of environmental processes leading to the digital twin of Earth, the underlying novel research question that is going to be addressed in this project is How can we create a generic hybrid modelling framework for estimating a diverse set of environmental parameters In this project, we are going to address this research question by performing research on, , , , ,

ocean sciences or geosciences to furtherthe knowledge of flocculation processes occurring in natural and manmade suspensions of marine sediment principal investigator dr Henko de Stigter, , The Project, , Where finegrained marine sediments are being brought in suspension and become subject to transport by currents, flocculation processes play an important role in speeding up settling and redeposition of the sediment Understanding of factors controlling the flocculation process, and ability to predict how flocculation will affect the settling of suspended sediments, is of key importance in assessing the dispersion and impact of manmade sediment plumes generated by offshore dredging and deepsea mining operations In PLUMEFLOC, a collaborative project of Technical University Delft and NIOZ in which also partners from the offshore industry participate, flocculation processes are investigated at the microscale of physical interactions between sedimentary particles, at intermediate scale in lab experiments with flocculating sediment suspensions, and at macroscale involving monitoring at sea of flocculating natural and manmade sediment plumes Within this project, you

highly motivated postdoc candidate with a background in ocean sciences or geosciences to furtherthe knowledge of flocculation processes occurring in natural and manmade suspensions of marine sediment principal investigator dr Henko de Stigter, , , Where finegrained marine sediments are being brought in suspension and become subject to transport by currents, flocculation processes play an important role in speeding up settling and redeposition of the sediment Understanding of factors controlling the flocculation process, and ability to predict how flocculation will affect the settling of suspended sediments, is of key importance in assessing the dispersion and impact of manmade sediment plumes generated by offshore dredging and deepsea mining operations In PLUMEFLOC, a collaborative project of Technical University Delft and NIOZ in which also partners from the offshore industry participate, flocculation processes are investigated at the microscale of physical interactions between sedimentary particles, at intermediate scale in lab experiments with flocculating sediment suspensions, and at macroscale involving monitoring at sea of flocculating natural and manmade sediment plumes Within this project, you will 1 establish relationships between parameters describing texture and composition of natural sediments, such as particle size, mineralogy, content of total organic matter and of specific organic compounds, and the potential of these sediments to form flocculating suspensions, making use of analytical facilities available at NIOZ and 2 assist in experiments carried out at sea, directed at improving instrumental capabilities for insitu monitoring of suspended sediment plumes, including flocculation processes occurring in these plumes In both 1 and 2 there will be a strong interaction with the research group of TU Delft, , , , Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research NIOZ, , , , We are looking for a highly motivated candidate with doctoral degree in

Engineering we search an AssistantAssociate Professor in the domain of structural geology and geomechanics, , Strongly engaged in facilitating the energy transition, the Department of Geoscience  Engineering develops knowledge and tools to characterize the sedimentologically and structurally heterogeneous subsurface Numerical models are developed and used to predict the mechanical and fluidflow response to subsurface geoengineering activities related to resource extraction and storage, , Faults and networks of distributed fractures are key structural features impacting the behaviour of rocks They exert major influence on, for instance, the integrity of reservoir and storage rocks, and form pathways for the flow of fluids, potentially interacting with the country rock Their geometric and physical properties are key input data for predictive subsurface models, , The characterization of sedimentological and structural heterogeneities in subsurface rocks at the scale of meters to tens of meters is needed to constrain mechanical models able to predict, for instance, the state of stress in the entire volume of interest from the Earth surface to depths of several kilometers Accurate prediction of the state of stress is key, among others, to predict slip on faults during induced pressure changes and the stability of caves associated with dissolution mining, , Strong geological knowledge is needed to predict these properties and behaviours at the relevant scale of tens to thousands of meters For this purpose, we integrate processbased models of sedimentation and deformation with extensive work on outcrops Intensive collaboration with other disciplines present in the Department such as Reservoir engineering, Geophysics and Petrophysics, Resource Engineering and Geoengineering allows for a direct coupling between geological predictions and numerical models, , , , Delft University of Technology TU Delft, , , , The ideal candidate has a

Engineering we search an AssistantAssociate Professor in the domain of structural geology and geomechanics, , Strongly engaged in facilitating the energy transition, the Department of Geoscience  Engineering develops knowledge and tools to characterize the sedimentologically and structurally heterogeneous subsurface Numerical models are developed and used to predict the mechanical and fluidflow response to subsurface geoengineering activities related to resource extraction and storage, , Faults and networks of distributed fractures are key structural features impacting the behaviour of rocks They exert major influence on, for instance, the integrity of reservoir and storage rocks, and form pathways for the flow of fluids, potentially interacting with the country rock Their geometric and physical properties are key input data for predictive subsurface models, , The characterization of sedimentological and structural heterogeneities in subsurface rocks at the scale of meters to tens of meters is needed to constrain mechanical models able to predict, for instance, the state of stress in the entire volume of interest from the Earth surface to depths of several kilometers Accurate prediction of the state of stress is key, among others, to predict slip on faults during induced pressure changes and the stability of caves associated with dissolution mining, , Strong geological knowledge is needed to predict these properties and behaviours at the relevant scale of tens to thousands of meters For this purpose, we integrate processbased models of sedimentation and deformation with extensive work on outcrops Intensive collaboration with other disciplines present in the Department such as Reservoir engineering, Geophysics and Petrophysics,
