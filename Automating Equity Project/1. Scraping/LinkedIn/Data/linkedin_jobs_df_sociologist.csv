FTE: 0.8 - 1

VU unit : Faculty of Humanities, Department of Philosophy, & Faculty of Religion and Theology, Department Beliefs and Practices

Educational Level: PhD

Job description
The aim of this 1-year postdoc is to carry out a replication study of John Hedley Brooke’s 1991 monograph Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives (2nd ed. 2014). While the subtitle of this book may suggest that this is a somewhat loose collection of essays, it is in fact a coherent monograph that defends, on the basis of a large number of case-studies, the so-called complexity thesis against both the conflict thesis and apologetic attempts to use science to defend religion. Brooke’s complexity thesis has been championed by many in the science & religion field. However, it has also been severely criticized, among others by Canadian sociologist Yves Gingras (e.g., in Science and Religion: An Impossible Dialogue (Cambridge: Polity Press 2017)). Such writings have themselves given rise to further criticisms and counter-criticisms, for instance, by Peter Harrison. It would, therefore, be desirable if the main conclusions of John Brooke’s original book could be replicated. In order for the project to be feasible, the postdoc will focus on the results of chapter III of the book, which argues that there is a positive correlation between religious reform and scientific reform.


The replication study will be pre-registered in accordance with the guidelines of the Open Science Foundation. The postdoc shall re-analyse the data provided in chapter III of the book, but also study new data from different religious reforms. The team will organize several consultation sessions in order to make sure the original research methods are fully understood and taken into account.


The project will be carried out in close collaboration with the subproject’s and the project’s leaders, to wit: Rik Peels, Gijsbert van den Brink, Lex Bouter, René van Woudenberg, and Jeroen de Ridder. The position includes ample funding for research and travel. A detailed project description is available here . Candidates are strongly encouraged to read the project description carefully when preparing their application. The postdoc project should start September 2021. The project is embedded both in the Philosophy Department (Faculty of Humanities) and the Faculty of Religion and Theology.


Your duties
publish one peer-reviewed replication study in a leading journal in the field of science & religion (e.g., Zygon ; Theology and Science ; Philosophy, Theology, and the Sciences ; Science, Religion and Culture ; Reviews in Science and Religion ) and publish one peer-reviewed article on replication in science & religion in a leading general philosophy of science journal (e.g. Philosophy of Science , British Journal for the History and Philosophy of Science , Research Integrity and Peer Review )
give at least two conference presentations
co-organize a workshop on replication in the humanities

Requirements
Candidates should hold a PhD in the discipline of religion studies, philosophy or any other relevant field in the humanities. The candidate should have demonstrable affinity with the contemporary science & religion debate. Excellent spoken and written English as well as strong academic writing skills are essential.
