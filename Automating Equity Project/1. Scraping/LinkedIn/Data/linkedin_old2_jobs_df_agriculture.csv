values  we look at real issues faced by local people and try to develop practical, sustainable alternatives We envision a sustainable Amazon where education and learning is the forefront for driving understanding and change The Amazon is under constant threat from many processes that cause habitat destruction such as logging, agriculture and mining Our sustainable initiative projects provide alternative forms of income that can help protect the rainforest as well as give people a livelihood This means that we help protect one of the most biodiverse places in the world, preventing the extinction of species, and other associated effects of rainforest destruction, such as climate change, , All our projects focus on two main areas which focuses directly on the rainforest, and where we work with local Communities The Manu Biosphere is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, with millions of species awaiting study, and numerous local communities living nearby, , In Manu we have a great opportunity to study conservation and biodiversity issues on micro and macro scales from endemic species of frogs that are not found anywhere else to a larger ecosystem approach By studying animal distribution and ecology on our reserve, looking at where they can be found, at what times and what weather conditions, we can begin to understand the relationship between the forest and the wildlife The people that live in Manu face issues of poverty, low education standards, malnutrition and lack of resources In trying to provide for their families, people can sometimes end up in dangerous, unsustainable jobs like slash and burn agriculture and illegal logging Our community projects were set up to investigate and provide alternative, safe, sustainable ways to earn their money and feed their families, , Research, , The Amazon is a delicately balanced ecosystem, however, human destruction of the rainforest is happening at such an alarming rate that these pristine environments are being systematically destroyed, , , , So what happens when a patch of destroyed rainforest is left alone, when the jungle is allowed to reclaim it and life slowly returns Our project is uniquely placed to investigate this, as for many years now our reserve has been naturally regenerating from when it was once farmland, , Our biodiversity monitoring plan is investigating the value of regenerating tropical rainforest for biodiversity and how species move back to forest that has a history of human disturbance This is the challenge we have set ourselves to answer through the Research Monitoring Programme, which is run in partnership with leading universities such as the University of Glasgow and Oxford University By developing longterm comparative studies we can understand how forests regenerate that have experienced different types and levels of disturbance We examine how the diversity of life can return if we promote and nurture successful rainforest regeneration As agricultural and industrial activities move into new areas to exploit, the biological value of regenerating forests is becoming increasingly important and our studies aim to investigate this, , Our scientific research programme has 3 main areas of focus, , As an intern, you will work alongside our field staff with the investigations that will answer these questions, , Mascotania Macaw monitoring programme, , The blueheaded macaw is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, meaning it is threatened with extinction The blueheaded macaw lives in a very specific habitat and so is heavily affected by deforestation and other human disturbances Their numbers are further damaged by exploitation for the pet trade, a growing problem in Peru, , So far we have found a decrease in the number of blueheaded macaws on the reserve over the past few years, correlating with an increase in tourist numbers Our aim is to successfully understand their behaviour and to educate tourists about responsible bird watching You will be involved in this by helping to monitor the number of blueheaded macaws visiting our clay lick at dawn as well as noting their activity, and recording the impacts of tourism on the birds, , Avian monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Bird species composition and diversity can signify many different things about the forest, such as forest type, structure, age, health, and level and type of human impact Hunting pressure and habitat fragmentation through roads and deforestation can largely affect bird populations For example, healthy populations of game birds such as guans, tinamous and trumpeters indicate low to zero hunting pressure, whilst the presence of a highly specialist species such as the harpy eagle may indicate undisturbed primary forest Not only is the ecology of many of these tropical foothill species poorly known, but the true value of regenerating forest for birds is understudied We conduct early morning transects along the reserve to listen and look for birds, , Butterfly monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , There are currently more than 550 known species of butterfly at the reserve Butterflies are significant bioindicators as well as pollinators for many plant species, which makes understanding their distribution throughout the forest, species density and fluctuations over time, a significant research project for us Butterfly larvae have highly specialised diets, so we can learn about the vegetation in each part of the forest by looking at the species we find in them, and by comparing our findings in each forest type we can see what effect regenerating forest has on species distribution, , You will be involved in setting up butterfly traps and bait, identifying them and recording new species to the reserve Butterflies teach us a lot about the forest and the changes that take place within it We are working on producing a comprehensive guide for visitors to the reserve, , Amphibian and reptile monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Amphibians are excellent indicator species as they are extremely vulnerable to changes in their environment They have very thin skin which they use for gas exchange, and this makes them very sensitive to chemical pollutants and also to changes in climate eg temperature and humidity This means that they are one of the most important bioindicator species on the reserve, but it also means they are incredibly vulnerable, and are threatened by human activity the world over Studying the way they use regenerating forest is therefore vital for assessing its conservation value, , Mammal monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , In order to understand the importance of regenerating rainforest for mammal species, we have used a series of camera traps set up around the reserve to capture images of mammals in all three forest types So far more than 40 large mammal species have been recorded at the MLC, including 13 individual jaguar Due to the elusive nature of many mammal species the rest of our research is more adhoc You may find yourself unexpectedly tracking puma prints for half an hour, or trying to frantically count the number of peccaries that just crossed your path These encounters are vital to our understanding of the way mammals use regenerating forest, , Sustainable Community Initiatives, , We work with local communities in Manu to create sustainable income that meets the challenges faced by remote rainforest towns Poverty and lack of access to higher education in Manu forces many families into unsustainable work such as illegal logging, slash and burn agriculture, and mining Not only are these often dangerous and unhealthy, with little financial return, they also contribute to rainforest destruction To date our community projects have positively impacted more than 600 people, , Biogardens, , We work specifically with local mothers to combat malnutrition, by providing resources and knowledge to build biogardens that produce nutritious, fresh food for families, and extra income through surplus crops So far volunteers and local mothers have created over 60 family biogardens, and have helped build two institutional biogardens Since beginning our work with biogardens in 2009, this has resulted in an annual increase in income for the direct beneficiaries of biogardens, and an increase in child nutrition and health, , Agroforestry, , The agroforestry plots are planted with local farmers, and provide both short and longterm income through producing sustainable wood with banana production This is an environmentally sustainable livelihood that provides a sustainable alternative to illegal logging activities in the surrounding forest Agroforestry encourages species diversity, increases soil nutrition, and creates carbon credits that can be sold to further support the project, , We have helped turn more than 61 hectares of abandoned and degraded land into agroforestry plots, which have subsequently seen increased biodiversity, help plant over 10,000 banana trees, 7,000 hardwood and softwood trees, and created the first program in Peru to ever commercialise carbon credits on behalf of a local community sold to Oriel College Oxford University, , all information above is subject to

'Government Administration']","Considering its economic structure and geographic features, Moldova is highly vulnerable to climate change and is exposed to disasters due to the hydrometeorological phenomena and natural hazards While drought and floods are among top hydrometeorological hazards caused by extreme weather and climate events, due to the current and projected abnormal high temperatures leading to water scarcity the incidence of forest fires is increasingly posing a threat to the natural ecosystems, agricultural system and human settlements With the projected decrease in surface water availability by 1620 by 2020 due to climate change, the water supply for all users requires adaptation options to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities related to water stress In Moldovas climate induced disasters are occurring more frequently and on a recurring basis, causing an average of 4 million US dollars per year of economic damage, , Climate scenarios also indicate the country is trending strongly towards becoming more arid This will intensify not only droughts but also fires Unfortunately, rural communities experience a capacity deficit in terms of fire prevention, preparedness and timely response mainly due to liquidation of over 400 equipped and capacitated firefighting units following the extensive privatization process from the 90s Subsequently, the intervention radius of 3 km according to norms increased to up to 1015 km in urban areas and 4050 km in rural areas where 70 of the total number of fires occur It resulted in increased response time and lower awareness of fire risks by the rural population, subsequently leading to considerable increase in loss of life, material damages and affected ecosystems It is widely accepted that rural women are disproportionately affected by fires due to them being mostly engaged in cooking in unsafe cookstoves and collection of firewood in ecosystems that might be at high risk of fires Overall, during 2008 and 2017, in Moldova were registered about 8 725 fires resulting in 1 356 deaths, including 61 children In the rural areas, poor and lowincome households are mostly exposed to fire risks due to also lack of proper fire prevention measures and adapted techniques, education and awareness, , Against this background, the project aims to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of rural communities to climate change and disasters through improved water storage infrastructures and disasters risk reduction measures The project is supporting implementation of climatesmart water management solutions for agriculture, flood management and fire prevention and expansion of communitybased rescuefirefighting teams in rural communities of Moldova with the purpose to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of the rural communities to climate change and disaster risks The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months and the activities are clustered around 2 major outputs intended to produce an impact in 5 districts of Moldova, Central Hincesti, Criuleni and Ungheni districts and Southern Leova and Cantemir, , The expected impact of the project is improved resilience of rural communities livelihoods in the face of climate change, , The overall project outcome is strengthened local policies, capacities and infrastructure which enable climate and disaster resilient development at the community level, , The projects outputs are the following, , Output 1  Adaptation interventions in the water sector for agricultural purposes and flood management demonstrated and local climate change related policy frameworks in place in a selected number of districts, , Output 2  Communitylevel climate and disaster management capacities improved for risk reduction, prevention and timely response, , Under the 1st Output 2 major activities will be implemented 11 Mainstream climate change adaptation and disaster risk management priorities into local development planning frameworks with intention to widely involve various stakeholders ranging from private sector to vulnerable groups out of which 50 will be women into policy and decisionmaking over priorities that affect their wellbeing and 12 Water storage infrastructures piloted in 5 districts of the country to enhance adaptation to climate change in the water and agricultural sectors by supporting with grants at least 15 farmers, including women, to put in place climatesmart water systems, such as for instance, water storage basins, , Under the 2d Output 2 major activities will be

Services']","Introduction, , The African Union  Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources AUIBAR is a specialized technical Office of the Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture DREA of the African Union Commission AUC AUIBARs mandate is to support and coordinate the utilization of livestock, fisheries and wildlife as a resource for both human wellbeing and economic development in the Member States of the African Union AU The mission of AUIBAR is to provide leadership in the development of animal resources in Africa through supporting and empowering AU Member States and Regional Economic Communities RECs, , In line with the AUIBAR mandate of providing leadership and coordination in the sustainable development of Animal Resources in the continent, AUIBAR is implementing a 5year project on Sustainable Development of Livestock for Livelihoods in Africa  Live2Africa  The project pioneers a coherent continental programme approach to build systemic capacity in seven livestock components, that include Investment in Value Chains, Animal Health Animal Production, Productivity and Ecosystem Management Resilience Building Technology adoption in the Value Chains to inputs, Services and markets and Strengthening institutional capacities, , The overall objective of the project is To support transformation of the African livestock sector for enhanced contribution to environmentally sustainable, climate resilient, socioeconomic development and equitable growth while the specific objective is to strengthen the systemic capacity of continental, regional and national Livestock Sector stakeholders for the economically, environmentally and socially sustainable transformation of the livestock sector, , Under the Live2Africa project, support to promotion of regional livestock value chain is critical and hence the drive through regional economic communities to increase investment in Livestock Value Chains The Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD region in particular, under its Strategic Action 2 seeks to enhance commercialization of the regional LVC Enhance Commercialization through catalyzing Private Public Partnerships PPPs to increase investments, create smart partnerships for extension, inputs  services delivery, transportation, slaughter, distribution, quality assurance, etc This strategic action requires the initial action of undertaking a

countries In the region, over 80 of the above supply is sourced from the pastoral and agropastoral communities who mainly depend on livestock for livelihoods and income This trading is believed to support about 3 million households in the region, , Livestock value chains are complex, comprising compound networks, relationships, and transactions, as at each stage or transaction, the animal or its product gains value either as its quality improves or as its delivery to the final consumer is made more efficient Therefore to ensure efficiency, quality and system competitiveness, value chain analysis and mapping is critical as it provides important insights into four main issues of any sector, these include macroeconomic issues Governance issues, social capital issues and dynamics of interlinkages In addition, value chain analysis provides a knowledge platform especially for new producers including the small holders who are trying to penetrate global markets It further provides an analytical tool to better understand the policy environment identify the economic, environmental and social drivers business linkages and global market environment and promotes systemic competitiveness, , Currently, the need to drive the adoption of a marketoriented value chain approach has heightened It has been emphasized that through this action, interventions that are demand driven and meet market requirements should be promoted This approach will encourage greater productivity, improve supply linkages, strengthen relationships among suppliers and attract investment across the whole the value chain, ultimately leading to increased incomes for all actors , , In response to the growing global and continental needs to enhance value chain efficiency, IGAD member

needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design process, , Research field, Shaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models that, , and matching numerical simulation and dynamic analysis tools that support design decisions and design optimization These multiphysics modelling and dynamic analysis tools can then 1 be employed as a platform in which interdisciplinary design tradeoffs can be made explicit and on which early design decisions can be based and 2 serve as collaborative platforms for multidisciplinary engineering design teams The ultimate goal is to exploit these tools for the development of novel design concepts for the futures engineering systems and processes, providing solutions to societal challenges on energy, health, food, etc, , This research theme provides ample opportunity for fundamental, interdisciplinary research and valorization in a wide range of applications, many of which are strongly rooted in the Dutch hightech  manufacturing industry, and the agriculture and transportation sectors, , Research field candidates, , , , The

is a research partner in the large European collaborative LEX4BIO research program to address the sustainability challenges of agriculture through studying the potential application of biobased fertilizers BBFs produced from nutrientrich sidestreams NRSS such as sewage sludge, municipal biowaste and food industry byproducts The conversion of nutrients in NRSS into BBFs offers great potential for fulfilling the needs of farmers and consumer while reducing dependence upon mineralfossil fertilizers, closing the nutrient cycles and balance nutrients in the soil However, rigorous scientific research is needed to ensure that such BBFs can be used in a safe and sustainable manner both with respect to the environment and to human health NRSSs potentially contain a large number of toxic organic pollutants, heavy metals, and bacteria that may persist in the BBFs produced from them Upon their application, such pollutants may find their way into the soil and groundwater, as well as into the crops that are subsequently consumed by humans, , The aim of the overarching research program of the UvA is to determine risks related to the application of BBFs, including risks related to food safety, human health and environmental losses and producing solid guidelines for safe use of BBFs The postdoc position plays a crucial role in this UvA program, and will be embedded in a larger

Netherlands","['Higher Education', 'Research', 'Mechanical or Industrial Engineering']","Job Description, , General, The design of dynamical systems is a cornerstone discipline within Mechanical Engineering and industry needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design process, , Research field, Shaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which eg has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models that, , and matching numerical simulation and dynamic analysis tools that support design decisions and design optimization These multiphysics modelling and dynamic analysis tools can then 1 be employed as a platform in which interdisciplinary design tradeoffs can be made explicit and on which early design decisions can be based and 2 serve

Technology and Services', 'Research', 'Hospital & Health Care']","General, The design of dynamical systems is a cornerstone discipline within Mechanical Engineering and industry needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design process, , Research field, Shaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which eg has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models that, , and matching numerical simulation and dynamic analysis tools that support design decisions and design optimization These multiphysics modelling and dynamic analysis tools can then 1 be employed as a platform in which interdisciplinary design tradeoffs can be made explicit and on which early design decisions can be based and 2 serve as collaborative platforms for multidisciplinary engineering design teams The ultimate goal is to exploit these tools for the development of novel design concepts for the futures engineering systems and processes, providing solutions to societal challenges on energy, health, food, etc, , This research theme provides ample opportunity for fundamental, interdisciplinary research and valorization in a wide range of applications, many of which are strongly rooted in the Dutch hightech  manufacturing industry, and the agriculture and transportation sectors, , Research field candidates, , , , The Department of Mechanical Engineering of the TUe seeks to hire an outstanding tenuretrack assistant professor in the field of Multiphysics Dynamical System Design, which should play a leading role in addressing these challenges and trends in the abovementioned areas, , Candidates who apply are expected to have a solid background on at least two of the core disciplines mentioned above More importantly, the candidate should aspire to function in a multidisciplinary research environment The candidate should have the ambition set up a strong, internationally renowned research group, while fostering a collaborative network with other academics working on the topic within the department, the university and industry The candidate should contribute to the progress in the field of modelbased dynamical systems design, in order to be able to meet the future demands on engineering system design in industry and society, , Education, The candidate will contribute to the existing BSc program Mechanical Engineering and the MSc programs Mechanical Engineering ME and Systems and Control SC within the department, , , The candidates group will initially be embedded in existing groups in the Department, in particular the groups within the sections of Dynamics and Control andor Control Systems Technology The department fosters a personnel strategy stimulating personal growth towards faculty forming independent groups within larger coherent sections, , The Department of Mechanical Engineering currently seeks to hire three tenuretrack assistant professors with a focus on Engineering Design, each with an individual disciplinary emphasis, one on Dynamical Systems and Control, related to the above profile, one on Energy and Flow and one on Materials and Mechanics The candidate is expected to develop an independent profile while actively seeking collaboration with the other faculty focusing on engineering design aspects and contributing to the building of a multidisciplinary engineering

'Research', 'Financial Services']","General, The design of dynamical systems is a cornerstone discipline within Mechanical Engineering and industry needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design process, Research field, Shaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which eg has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models that, , and matching numerical simulation and dynamic analysis tools that support design decisions and design optimization These multiphysics modelling and dynamic analysis tools can then 1 be employed as a platform in which interdisciplinary design tradeoffs can be made explicit and on which early design decisions can be based and 2 serve as collaborative platforms for multidisciplinary engineering design teams The ultimate goal is to exploit these tools for the development of novel design concepts for the futures engineering systems and processes, providing solutions to societal challenges on energy, health, food, etc, , This research theme provides ample opportunity for fundamental, interdisciplinary research and valorization in a wide range of applications, many of which are strongly rooted in the Dutch hightech  manufacturing industry, and the agriculture and transportation sectors, , Research field candidates, The Department of Mechanical Engineering of the TUe seeks to hire an outstanding tenuretrack assistant professor in the field of Multiphysics Dynamical System Design, which should play a leading role in addressing these challenges and trends in the abovementioned areas Core disciplines that are envisioned to be needed are, , Candidates who apply are expected to have a solid background on at least two of the core disciplines mentioned above More importantly, the candidate should aspire to function in a multidisciplinary research environment The candidate should have the ambition set up a strong, internationally renowned research group, while fostering a collaborative network with other academics working on the topic within the department, the university and industry The candidate should contribute to the progress in the field of modelbased dynamical systems design, in order to be able to meet the future demands on engineering system design in industry and society, , Education, The candidate will contribute to the existing BSc program Mechanical

Netherlands four universities of technology TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, University of Twente and Wageningen University work together closely to make a significant impact on social challenges in the long term, , Robots that will daily operate in human environments, will need a soft touch The robots we know from industrial production, are extremely precise and fast, but very rigid as well For physical and safe contact with people, or for handling vulnerable food products, they dont perform well The 4TU Soft Robotics program chooses a natureinspired approach the grip of a tree frog and the flexible arm of a cuttlefish  wwwdutchsoftroboticsnl  For this, knowledge of biology, fully new control systems, and innovative robot design strategies go hand in hand The partners of the technical universities strengthen each other in this, , Soft robotics is a very young and promising field and offers an exciting, radically different approach to operate safely and reliably in humaninhabited environments Our ambition is to take the lead in realizing the next generation of soft robotic systems through the integrated design of affordable flexible hardware, powerefficient lightweight actuators, and efficient and intuitive control Inspired by biology, new transduction principles and geometries will be explored, characterized by flexible geometries of materials with imperfect and anisotropic properties Our vision embraces the integrated design of soft robots, including desirable mechanical properties, embedded sensing, and actuation, modeling, and control From this vision, many scientific challenges arise in the areas of statics, dynamics and materials and transducers science for which you will take the lead in progressing these fields, , For example, the flexibility of soft robots poses challenges on its modelling and control the models have to be quite accurate to mimic flexible nature of the robots, and at the same time the model complexity can hamper the application of the control design methods so to find a reasonable tradeoff between the model accuracy and its applicability for control is one of the core research questions posed A flexible structure with embedded transduction is so dissimilar to the regular transducers mounted on stiff robots, that for both the description and understanding of the transducers as well as for their use in soft robotic control schemes, we will have to develop new theoretical and practical bioinspired control frameworks, , You will be working in a team of top scientists and you will have the opportunity to carry out excellent research, set up and contribute to educational programs and work on concrete solutions within our broad network of partners in policy and practice The 4TU Soft Robotics program offers prospective candidates excellent opportunities to extend their networks with academic and societal partners, , As a postdoc you will enhance the cooperation between the academic partners involved in the Soft Robotics 4TU program via application of developed design techniques to the emerging use cases from the following areas modern manufacturing systems, health care, soft cooperative robots for agriculture, , , , In the section research focuses on the modeling, analysis and control of mechanical systems in a broad sense This encompasses typical areas as mechatronics, modern vehicle control and last but not least automation of mechanical systems The latter subject is nowadays a key driver for research in robotics Besides various more industrial robotic applications in industry and agriculture, an important field is formed by robots for care and for cure Though very different in usage, both directions have great potential for the future of mankind A recent very relevant development in robotics for care and cure is framed as soft robotics where because of the very nature of a soft robot, humanrobot interaction and safety is of primal importance, , , , , , ,
