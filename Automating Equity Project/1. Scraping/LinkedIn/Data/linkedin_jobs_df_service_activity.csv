Our mission
Building Europe’s most valuable open data money platform. How? With our two strong and proven brands…
Our Yolt App
Yolt is a multi-award-winning app that makes managing money, easy. At the forefront of innovation enabled by PSD2 and powered by open banking technology, our smart thinking money app gives users a clear overview of their connected bank accounts, credit cards, and spending together in one place.

We've recently launched a series of innovative features designed to help people spend smart and save through small tweaks to their daily routines and easy automatic actions within the app.
Our YTS Platform
Yolt Technology Services (YTS) is the leading open banking provider in Europe, building, managing, and maintaining AIS and PIS connections for top financial institutions and ambitious tech businesses. In January 2018, we became the first-ever Third-Party Provider to successfully make an open banking API call. Just over two years later, we have now made more than 1 billion API calls, accounting for 50% of all traffic.
What we’re looking for
We’re after enthusiastic, driven individuals who want to want to contribute to our journey and grow with us along the way. Can you hit the ground running? Do you have the drive to go faster? Fintech is fast-paced, but we always remember to switch off too.
Our KYC team

As KYC Expert, you will be working directly with our in-house KYC Specialist and be responsible for assisting in monitoring and developing all Yolt KYC activities. You’ll report to our COO, and be part of our larger operations team in which you’ll also be working closely together with our Fraud Analyst for example.

What you’ll be doing

Yolt is a rapidly evolving FinTech working in uncharted KYC territory. We hold a different position than traditional financial services organizations because we are an account information service provider (AISP) with payment initiation services (PISP). You can see us as inventors within KYC and Compliance because a lot is still very new, we like to say we're in ground-breaking territory, having to set the rules of the game.

For both our brands we perform CDD and transaction monitoring on private individuals and entities. As KYC Expert you have a good understanding, backed by experience, of what it means to perform KYC, CDD, CAM, and transaction monitoring activities in a FinTech environment. With your experience, you know how to set up frameworks and contribute to bringing more and more structure

In this role, you'll support our innovative identification and verification (CDD) and Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM) processes. We're in the stage where we've still outsourced some CDD processes but also developed in-house CDD and CAM processes. Yolt is a fast-paced, dynamic and agile environment which means you'll have a broad scope with changing responsibilities.
This is an idea of what you can expect to do:
Assess and decide on a case‐by‐case basis what measures should be taken with regard to special investigations (e.g. alerts, ml/tf suspicion) from our outsourced activities and instruct the operations team on which follow-up action to execute.
Implement on-going improvements for in house performed activities and set up for Clients in Yolt’s B2B proposition.
Liaise with the CDD Partner’s Operational Team and the Yolt Customer Support Team to assist prospective customers with completing mobile onboarding.
Perform key control testing based on the identification and verification process performed by the CDD Partner.
Work closely with the Yolt Product Owner and in-house KYC Specialist to suggest adequate and/or preventive measures to continuously improve the KYC processes and systems.
Assist the in-house KYC Specialist with internal and external reporting to the Yolt Management, ING Compliance, etc.
Perform in house CAM and alert handling and report results to internal stakeholders.
Constantly align with Yolt Compliance in order to translate strategic, tactical, and operational policy in the field of Financial Economic Crime (FEC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM), and Fraud.
What you'll need

Our ideal candidate is an experienced and driven individual, that is excited about data analysis, research, and investigations, a multi-tasker that understands risk and compliance topics.

The KYC Specialist should have a healthy balance of the following skills:

Experience and knowledge of FEC and AML regulations
Sticks to agreements and keeps to the letter of the law (incl. internal policies and regulations)
Forms her/his own opinion and possess strong verbal and written communication skills
Has increased learning ability and passion for investigation and data analysis
Is consistent in the approach but also flexible to adapt where needed based on data
What you need to know about us

You'll join a small, dedicated team of highly skilled people who are committed to changing the way people think about money. We operate in a unique space on the boundaries of a large multinational bank, ING Bank N.V, but with the energetic, fast-paced attitude of a start-up with offices in Amsterdam, London, and Katowice. We don’t like to brag, but we’re proud of the fact we’re leveraging the power unleashed by PSD2 and open banking to deliver the most innovative money app out there, recently winning the coveted ‘Best personal Finance App’ at the 2020 Wealth and Finance Fintech Awards.

As KYC Expert, you will be working directly with our in-house KYC Specialist and be responsible for assisting in monitoring and developing all Yolt KYC activities. You’ll report to our COO, and be part of our larger operations team in which you’ll also be working closely together with our Fraud Analyst for example.

Our mission
Building Europe’s most valuable open data money platform. How? With our two strong and proven brands…
Our Yolt App
Yolt is a multi-award-winning app that makes managing money, easy. At the forefront of innovation enabled by PSD2 and powered by open banking technology, our smart thinking money app gives users a clear overview of their connected bank accounts, credit cards, and spending together in one place.

We've recently launched a series of innovative features designed to help people spend smart and save through small tweaks to their daily routines and easy automatic actions within the app.
Our YTS Platform
Yolt Technology Services (YTS) is the leading open banking provider in Europe, building, managing, and maintaining AIS and PIS connections for top financial institutions and ambitious tech businesses. In January 2018, we became the first-ever Third-Party Provider to successfully make an open banking API call. Just over two years later, we have now made more than 1 billion API calls, accounting for 50% of all traffic.
What we’re looking for
We’re after enthusiastic, driven individuals who want to want to contribute to our journey and grow with us along the way. Can you hit the ground running? Do you have the drive to go faster? Fintech is fast-paced, but we always remember to switch off too.
Our KYC team

As KYC Expert, you will be working directly with our in-house KYC Specialist and be responsible for assisting in monitoring and developing all Yolt KYC activities. You’ll report to our COO, and be part of our larger operations team in which you’ll also be working closely together with our Fraud Analyst for example.

What you’ll be doing

Yolt is a rapidly evolving FinTech working in uncharted KYC territory. We hold a different position than traditional financial services organizations because we are an account information service provider (AISP) with payment initiation services (PISP). You can see us as inventors within KYC and Compliance because a lot is still very new, we like to say we're in ground-breaking territory, having to set the rules of the game.

For both our brands we perform CDD and transaction monitoring on private individuals and entities. As KYC Expert you have a good understanding, backed by experience, of what it means to perform KYC, CDD, CAM, and transaction monitoring activities in a FinTech environment. With your experience, you know how to set up frameworks and contribute to bringing more and more structure

In this role, you'll support our innovative identification and verification (CDD) and Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM) processes. We're in the stage where we've still outsourced some CDD processes but also developed in-house CDD and CAM processes. Yolt is a fast-paced, dynamic and agile environment which means you'll have a broad scope with changing responsibilities.
This is an idea of what you can expect to do:
Assess and decide on a case‐by‐case basis what measures should be taken with regard to special investigations (e.g. alerts, ml/tf suspicion) from our outsourced activities and instruct the operations team on which follow-up action to execute.
Implement on-going improvements for in house performed activities and set up for Clients in Yolt’s B2B proposition.
Liaise with the CDD Partner’s Operational Team and the Yolt Customer Support Team to assist prospective customers with completing mobile onboarding.
Perform key control testing based on the identification and verification process performed by the CDD Partner.
Work closely with the Yolt Product Owner and in-house KYC Specialist to suggest adequate and/or preventive measures to continuously improve the KYC processes and systems.
Assist the in-house KYC Specialist with internal and external reporting to the Yolt Management, ING Compliance, etc.
Perform in house CAM and alert handling and report results to internal stakeholders.
Constantly align with Yolt Compliance in order to translate strategic, tactical, and operational policy in the field of Financial Economic Crime (FEC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM), and Fraud.
What you'll need

Our ideal candidate is an experienced and driven individual, that is excited about data analysis, research, and investigations, a multi-tasker that understands risk and compliance topics.

The KYC Specialist should have a healthy balance of the following skills:

Experience and knowledge of FEC and AML regulations
Sticks to agreements and keeps to the letter of the law (incl. internal policies and regulations)
Forms her/his own opinion and possess strong verbal and written communication skills
Has increased learning ability and passion for investigation and data analysis
Is consistent in the approach but also flexible to adapt where needed based on data

In January 2018, we became the first-ever Third-Party Provider to successfully make an open banking API call. Just over two years later, we have now made more than 1 billion API calls, accounting for 50% of all traffic.
What we’re looking for
We’re after enthusiastic, driven individuals who want to want to contribute to our journey and grow with us along the way. Can you hit the ground running? Do you have the drive to go faster? Fintech is fast-paced, but we always remember to switch off too.
Our KYC team

As KYC Expert, you will be working directly with our in-house KYC Specialist and be responsible for assisting in monitoring and developing all Yolt KYC activities. You’ll report to our COO, and be part of our larger operations team in which you’ll also be working closely together with our Fraud Analyst for example.

What you’ll be doing

Yolt is a rapidly evolving FinTech working in uncharted KYC territory. We hold a different position than traditional financial services organizations because we are an account information service provider (AISP) with payment initiation services (PISP). You can see us as inventors within KYC and Compliance because a lot is still very new, we like to say we're in ground-breaking territory, having to set the rules of the game.

For both our brands we perform CDD and transaction monitoring on private individuals and entities. As KYC Expert you have a good understanding, backed by experience, of what it means to perform KYC, CDD, CAM, and transaction monitoring activities in a FinTech environment. With your experience, you know how to set up frameworks and contribute to bringing more and more structure

In this role, you'll support our innovative identification and verification (CDD) and Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM) processes. We're in the stage where we've still outsourced some CDD processes but also developed in-house CDD and CAM processes. Yolt is a fast-paced, dynamic and agile environment which means you'll have a broad scope with changing responsibilities.
This is an idea of what you can expect to do:
Assess and decide on a case‐by‐case basis what measures should be taken with regard to special investigations (e.g. alerts, ml/tf suspicion) from our outsourced activities and instruct the operations team on which follow-up action to execute.
Implement on-going improvements for in house performed activities and set up for Clients in Yolt’s B2B proposition.
Liaise with the CDD Partner’s Operational Team and the Yolt Customer Support Team to assist prospective customers with completing mobile onboarding.
Perform key control testing based on the identification and verification process performed by the CDD Partner.
Work closely with the Yolt Product Owner and in-house KYC Specialist to suggest adequate and/or preventive measures to continuously improve the KYC processes and systems.
Assist the in-house KYC Specialist with internal and external reporting to the Yolt Management, ING Compliance, etc.
Perform in house CAM and alert handling and report results to internal stakeholders.
Constantly align with Yolt Compliance in order to translate strategic, tactical, and operational policy in the field of Financial Economic Crime (FEC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), Customer Activity Monitoring (CAM), and Fraud.
What you'll need

Our ideal candidate is an experienced and driven individual, that is excited about data analysis, research, and investigations, a multi-tasker that understands risk and compliance topics.

The KYC Specialist should have a healthy balance of the following skills:

Experience and knowledge of FEC and AML regulations
Sticks to agreements and keeps to the letter of the law (incl. internal policies and regulations)
Forms her/his own opinion and possess strong verbal and written communication skills
Has increased learning ability and passion for investigation and data analysis
Is consistent in the approach but also flexible to adapt where needed based on data
What you need to know about us

You'll join a small, dedicated team of highly skilled people who are committed to changing the way people think about money. We operate in a unique space on the boundaries of a large multinational bank, ING Bank N.V, but with the energetic, fast-paced attitude of a start-up with offices in Amsterdam, London, and Katowice. We don’t like to brag, but we’re proud of the fact we’re leveraging the power unleashed by PSD2 and open banking to deliver the most innovative money app out there, recently winning the coveted ‘Best personal Finance App’ at the 2020 Wealth and Finance Fintech Awards.

Job title: Account Executive, Planning
Group: Mindshare Worldwide
Client: Nike, Amsterdam
Reports to: Account Manager
Company Background
Ours is the story of the eternal upstart and change is in our DNA. We were born with the ambition to change the world through media. Raised in Asia, we are now the world’s most geographically balanced global network spanning US, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Mindshare’s birth in 1997 shifted the focus from media as a pure commodity to media as a change agent.
Our ambition was to go beyond the traditional media descriptors of “Optimise, Capitalise, Maximise.” We will not be defined by the formulaic definitions of media. Mindshare’s story is about teamwork. It’s why we called ourselves Mindshare in the first place!
We were designed to be a global network, balanced in every region, with clients benefitting from both global and local insights. Today 75% of our business is global and our global network and integrated approach is our strength. We are a global media agency network with billings in excess of US$24 billion (source: COMvergence) and our network consists of more than 7,000 employees, in 116 offices across 86 countries. Mindshare is part of GroupM, which oversees the media investment management sector for WPP, the world’s leading communications services group.
Discrimination, oppression and inequities towards people of different race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, abilities, age or any other differences, are unacceptable and have no place in the world or amongst our Mindshare family. We strive for an environment where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, has equal access to opportunities and resources, whose voice is heard and who can contribute to the organisation’s success.
The Role
The candidate will report to the Account Manager. Working within the Planning team, you’ll be instrumental in supporting the Nike planning team at Mindshare to create + manage Nike campaigns across EMEA.
The Client
The Mindshare Nike team in Amsterdam is responsible for Nike’s media output across EMEA markets.
This Nike role is incredibly creative. As the media team, we impact the idea far more than you see on other clients. We do all of it for Nike: planning, buying, production – and we have a distinctive view on what constitutes “Nike media” and the future of communications.
A Unique Team & Client
The Nike EMEA team at Mindshare is collaborative like no other. We are an extension of Nike’s own Integrated Media team, in daily communication with a range of clients and often working from the Nike European campus at Hilversum.
We are a passionate and closely-knit group who are committed to helping each other thrive – we want to work with people who can bring vibrant personalities to the group.
Qualities we aim for in the team: Knowing what’s out there (and what’s coming): Good knowledge of key channels, platforms and media owners across EMEA. A passion for sports: All sports are welcome at Nike – if you have a body, you are an athlete. For this role, a passion and knowledge of a range of sports is ideal. Tenacious & energetic: you have an eye for detail along with a desire to do great work (and help others do the same) Culturally curious: Know what’s in, what’s out and what’s next. Be able to make observations on behaviour and provide POV for Nike. Fluency in a second language is a bonus. A head for digital: the key to the future is having a grasp of data + analytics (the science to go along with the art!)
The Person
You will be a self-starter who is eager to work and learn within a dynamic unit. You’re a team player who is able to manage their time effectively across a number of projects.
Ideally you will have some experience in a similar agency role or have spent considerable time in a related internship.
But rules are there to be broken and the right person will be smart, driven and excited by the challenge of working with the world’s #1 sports brand. If you think that might be you, we want to hear from you.
We work with a fast-moving client, so you need to be comfortable with that. We work in a sports environment; its unpredictable and dramatic, and incredibly fun. So, you need to enjoy an adrenalin rush every now and then.

Job title: Account Executive, Planning
Group: Mindshare Worldwide
Client: Nike, Amsterdam
Reports to: Account Manager
Company Background
Ours is the story of the eternal upstart and change is in our DNA. We were born with the ambition to change the world through media. Raised in Asia, we are now the world’s most geographically balanced global network spanning US, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Mindshare’s birth in 1997 shifted the focus from media as a pure commodity to media as a change agent.
Our ambition was to go beyond the traditional media descriptors of “Optimise, Capitalise, Maximise.” We will not be defined by the formulaic definitions of media. Mindshare’s story is about teamwork. It’s why we called ourselves Mindshare in the first place!
We were designed to be a global network, balanced in every region, with clients benefitting from both global and local insights. Today 75% of our business is global and our global network and integrated approach is our strength. We are a global media agency network with billings in excess of US$24 billion (source: COMvergence) and our network consists of more than 7,000 employees, in 116 offices across 86 countries. Mindshare is part of GroupM, which oversees the media investment management sector for WPP, the world’s leading communications services group.
Discrimination, oppression and inequities towards people of different race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, abilities, age or any other differences, are unacceptable and have no place in the world or amongst our Mindshare family. We strive for an environment where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, has equal access to opportunities and resources, whose voice is heard and who can contribute to the organisation’s success.
The Role
The candidate will report to the Account Manager. Working within the Planning team, you’ll be instrumental in supporting the Nike planning team at Mindshare to create + manage Nike campaigns across EMEA.
The Client
The Mindshare Nike team in Amsterdam is responsible for Nike’s media output across EMEA markets.
This Nike role is incredibly creative. As the media team, we impact the idea far more than you see on other clients. We do all of it for Nike: planning, buying, production – and we have a distinctive view on what constitutes “Nike media” and the future of communications.
A Unique Team & Client
The Nike EMEA team at Mindshare is collaborative like no other. We are an extension of Nike’s own Integrated Media team, in daily communication with a range of clients and often working from the Nike European campus at Hilversum.
We are a passionate and closely-knit group who are committed to helping each other thrive – we want to work with people who can bring vibrant personalities to the group.

Qualities we aim for in the team: Knowing what’s out there (and what’s coming): Good knowledge of key channels, platforms and media owners across EMEA. A passion for sports: All sports are welcome at Nike – if you have a body, you are an athlete. For this role, a passion and knowledge of a range of sports is ideal. Tenacious & energetic: you have an eye for detail along with a desire to do great work (and help others do the same) Culturally curious: Know what’s in, what’s out and what’s next. Be able to make observations on behaviour and provide POV for Nike. Fluency in a second language is a bonus. A head for digital: the key to the future is having a grasp of data + analytics (the science to go along with the art!)
The Person
You will be a self-starter who is eager to work and learn within a dynamic unit. You’re a team player who is able to manage their time effectively across a number of projects.
Ideally you will have some experience in a similar agency role or have spent considerable time in a related internship.
But rules are there to be broken and the right person will be smart, driven and excited by the challenge of working with the world’s #1 sports brand. If you think that might be you, we want to hear from you.
We work with a fast-moving client, so you need to be comfortable with that. We work in a sports environment; its unpredictable and dramatic, and incredibly fun. So, you need to enjoy an adrenalin rush every now and then.

Job title: Account Executive, Planning
Group: Mindshare Worldwide
Client: Nike, Amsterdam
Reports to: Account Manager
Company Background
Ours is the story of the eternal upstart and change is in our DNA. We were born with the ambition to change the world through media. Raised in Asia, we are now the world’s most geographically balanced global network spanning US, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Mindshare’s birth in 1997 shifted the focus from media as a pure commodity to media as a change agent.
Our ambition was to go beyond the traditional media descriptors of “Optimise, Capitalise, Maximise.” We will not be defined by the formulaic definitions of media. Mindshare’s story is about teamwork. It’s why we called ourselves Mindshare in the first place!
We were designed to be a global network, balanced in every region, with clients benefitting from both global and local insights. Today 75% of our business is global and our global network and integrated approach is our strength. We are a global media agency network with billings in excess of US$24 billion (source: COMvergence) and our network consists of more than 7,000 employees, in 116 offices across 86 countries. Mindshare is part of GroupM, which oversees the media investment management sector for WPP, the world’s leading communications services group.
Discrimination, oppression and inequities towards people of different race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, abilities, age or any other differences, are unacceptable and have no place in the world or amongst our Mindshare family. We strive for an environment where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, has equal access to opportunities and resources, whose voice is heard and who can contribute to the organisation’s success.
The Role
The candidate will report to the Account Manager. Working within the Planning team, you’ll be instrumental in supporting the Nike planning team at Mindshare to create + manage Nike campaigns across EMEA.
The Client
The Mindshare Nike team in Amsterdam is responsible for Nike’s media output across EMEA markets.
This Nike role is incredibly creative. As the media team, we impact the idea far more than you see on other clients. We do all of it for Nike: planning, buying, production – and we have a distinctive view on what constitutes “Nike media” and the future of communications.

Mindshare’s birth in 1997 shifted the focus from media as a pure commodity to media as a change agent.
Our ambition was to go beyond the traditional media descriptors of “Optimise, Capitalise, Maximise.” We will not be defined by the formulaic definitions of media. Mindshare’s story is about teamwork. It’s why we called ourselves Mindshare in the first place!
We were designed to be a global network, balanced in every region, with clients benefitting from both global and local insights. Today 75% of our business is global and our global network and integrated approach is our strength. We are a global media agency network with billings in excess of US$24 billion (source: COMvergence) and our network consists of more than 7,000 employees, in 116 offices across 86 countries. Mindshare is part of GroupM, which oversees the media investment management sector for WPP, the world’s leading communications services group.
Discrimination, oppression and inequities towards people of different race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, abilities, age or any other differences, are unacceptable and have no place in the world or amongst our Mindshare family. We strive for an environment where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully, has equal access to opportunities and resources, whose voice is heard and who can contribute to the organisation’s success.
The Role
The candidate will report to the Account Manager. Working within the Planning team, you’ll be instrumental in supporting the Nike planning team at Mindshare to create + manage Nike campaigns across EMEA.
The Client
The Mindshare Nike team in Amsterdam is responsible for Nike’s media output across EMEA markets.
This Nike role is incredibly creative. As the media team, we impact the idea far more than you see on other clients. We do all of it for Nike: planning, buying, production – and we have a distinctive view on what constitutes “Nike media” and the future of communications.
A Unique Team & Client
The Nike EMEA team at Mindshare is collaborative like no other. We are an extension of Nike’s own Integrated Media team, in daily communication with a range of clients and often working from the Nike European campus at Hilversum.
We are a passionate and closely-knit group who are committed to helping each other thrive – we want to work with people who can bring vibrant personalities to the group.
Qualities we aim for in the team: Knowing what’s out there (and what’s coming): Good knowledge of key channels, platforms and media owners across EMEA. A passion for sports: All sports are welcome at Nike – if you have a body, you are an athlete. For this role, a passion and knowledge of a range of sports is ideal. Tenacious & energetic: you have an eye for detail along with a desire to do great work (and help others do the same) Culturally curious: Know what’s in, what’s out and what’s next. Be able to make observations on behaviour and provide POV for Nike. Fluency in a second language is a bonus. A head for digital: the key to the future is having a grasp of data + analytics (the science to go along with the art!)
The Person
You will be a self-starter who is eager to work and learn within a dynamic unit. You’re a team player who is able to manage their time effectively across a number of projects.
Ideally you will have some experience in a similar agency role or have spent considerable time in a related internship.
But rules are there to be broken and the right person will be smart, driven and excited by the challenge of working with the world’s #1 sports brand. If you think that might be you, we want to hear from you.
We work with a fast-moving client, so you need to be comfortable with that. We work in a sports environment; its unpredictable and dramatic, and incredibly fun. So, you need to enjoy an adrenalin rush every now and then.
Key Responsibilities Media Plan Management
Collating Excel media plans across all channels, uploading plans to Nike’s Plan Management System and ensuring they are kept up to date
Campaign Activation
Production

IMC is a leading global market maker, using algorithmic trading and advanced technology to buy and sell securities on multiple trading venues worldwide. We provide liquidity to the financial markets, driving efficiencies for buyers and sellers.

OUR TEAM
We now operate globally from offices in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Our employees work closely together in multidisciplinary teams, making our success possible.
Technology - At IMC, technology is not a department, it is at the heart of everything we do. Our technologists push the limits of possibility, and then look beyond. In our fast-paced environment, short feedback loops mean projects worked on in the morning can enter production the next day.
Trading – Although our traders come from many backgrounds they all have one thing in common: they are at their best solving complex problems. Their insight into global events, market shifts and pricing ensure we are trading in the right place, at the right time.
Business Support - Around the world, IMC’s business support teams are essential for sustaining our success. In our dynamic environment, we have many exciting challenges and multidisciplinary opportunities to shape our operations and make a real impact.

Monitoring and analyze intraday trading activity and discuss with our Trading Desks;
Advise traders on exchange rules and regulations

service activity,Indeed,p_97668a8973cccae3,Operational Compliance Analyst,IMC Financial Markets, Amsterdam,"LIFE AT IMC AS OPERATIONAL COMPLIANCE ANALYST
WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO
IMC is a leading global market maker, using algorithmic trading and advanced technology to buy and sell securities on multiple trading venues worldwide. We provide liquidity to the financial markets, driving efficiencies for buyers and sellers.
Founded in 1989, we are an ambitious, innovative company and identified early on the importance technology would play in the fast-paced evolution of trading. This entrepreneurial spirit still drives us today and can be found in all of our offices around the world.
OUR TEAM
We now operate globally from offices in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Our employees work closely together in multidisciplinary teams, making our success possible.
Technology - At IMC, technology is not a department, it is at the heart of everything we do. Our technologists push the limits of possibility, and then look beyond. In our fast-paced environment, short feedback loops mean projects worked on in the morning can enter production the next day.
Trading – Although our traders come from many backgrounds they all have one thing in common: they are at their best solving complex problems. Their insight into global events, market shifts and pricing ensure we are trading in the right place, at the right time.
Business Support - Around the world, IMC’s business support teams are essential for sustaining our success. In our dynamic environment, we have many exciting challenges and multidisciplinary opportunities to shape our operations and make a real impact.
OUR CULTURE
Our employees are our greatest asset so we give them lots of responsibility and the support they need to make a difference. Our flat structure fosters a culture of openness and collaboration, encouraging the sharing of ideas and knowledge. It makes no difference if you have been with us for three days or three years, the best idea wins.
While we work hard, we also have a lot of fun; whether solving complex challenges or in team building, leisure and sporting activities. IMC also enables its employees to contribute towards a better society through our foundation.
Are you someone who is passionate about challenging the status quo? Do you enjoy the process of problem solving, a process where you recognize areas of improvement and innovate to improve? Does your curiosity and desire to learn drive you?
WHAT YOU’LL DO
The Compliance team operates very close to our Trading and Technology teams. Main objective of the team is to ensure our organization complies at all times with external and internal regulation. We strongly believe a strong compliance culture can only be built when employees do not only adhere to the policies and rules, but also understand the context and intent of regulation. As a Compliance Analyst at IMC you will be based directly on the dealing room of our Amsterdam office. You will assist in managing the day-to-day compliance activities, like monitoring/reporting of our trading activities and onboarding counterparties.

To excel in this role you will be combining analytical skills with operational and system knowledge to add value, and not bureaucracy to the business. We are looking for someone who is used to working with large data sets and who has knowledge of programming languages, with a critical, proactive and hands-on approach.
Your tasks will include but not be limited to:
Ensure regulatory transaction reports are sent timely and accurate;
Ensure trading counterparties are on-boarded and reviewed timely (AML/KYC)
Monitoring and analyze intraday trading activity and discuss with our Trading Desks;
Advise traders on exchange rules and regulations
Assist with inquiries made by exchanges or regulators
Collaborate with global compliance team members to design and enhance global standards
Analyze developments within the markets we trade and identify both risks and opportunities;

WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO
IMC is a leading global market maker, using algorithmic trading and advanced technology to buy and sell securities on multiple trading venues worldwide. We provide liquidity to the financial markets, driving efficiencies for buyers and sellers.
Founded in 1989, we are an ambitious, innovative company and identified early on the importance technology would play in the fast-paced evolution of trading. This entrepreneurial spirit still drives us today and can be found in all of our offices around the world.
OUR TEAM
We now operate globally from offices in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Our employees work closely together in multidisciplinary teams, making our success possible.
Technology - At IMC, technology is not a department, it is at the heart of everything we do. Our technologists push the limits of possibility, and then look beyond. In our fast-paced environment, short feedback loops mean projects worked on in the morning can enter production the next day.
Trading – Although our traders come from many backgrounds they all have one thing in common: they are at their best solving complex problems. Their insight into global events, market shifts and pricing ensure we are trading in the right place, at the right time.
Business Support - Around the world, IMC’s business support teams are essential for sustaining our success. In our dynamic environment, we have many exciting challenges and multidisciplinary opportunities to shape our operations and make a real impact.
OUR CULTURE
Our employees are our greatest asset so we give them lots of responsibility and the support they need to make a difference. Our flat structure fosters a culture of openness and collaboration, encouraging the sharing of ideas and knowledge. It makes no difference if you have been with us for three days or three years, the best idea wins.

service activity,Indeed,p_1df07b7b84044d76,Senior Ruby on Rails Developer,Catawiki, Amsterdam,"The Catawiki Story

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every single day. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone.

In fact, 10 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent.

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 650+ Catawikians working across 7 International offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

How we work

As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a domain which brings plenty of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, mostly written in Ruby, to handle the high volume of requests served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, Continuous Delivery, A/B testing every assumption and using the observability and monitoring tools already in place. We make mistakes and learn valuable lessons from them. Our focus is to be able to recover and iterate quickly.

What you'll do

Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other members of the Development team, you will build scalable microservices while measuring and monitoring system performance. In addition, you will use experimentation, backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.

What you'll bring

We look for engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby and some Golang, however, if you're passionate about learning new things then prior experience with Ruby or Go is not essential. Next to this:

You have experience in designing, implementing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and consistency.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on customers.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you've got a story to tell, come and join us.

Working and hiring remotely
As we navigate through the Covid19 pandemic together, we want to reassure you that keeping candidates and our employees safe is of paramount importance to us. That's why the entire recruitment process will take place remotely, using phone and video calls. For successful applicants who end up being hired, we always ensure a safe, engaging, and (for the time being) remote onboarding experience. When it is safe to do so, Catawiki will be implementing a hybrid work policy where employees based in the Netherlands will work from the office once per week and from home for the rest. Outside of The Netherlands, we are able to employ people to work remotely in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium.

Here's what we can offer you
This is your chance to become part of a fast but sustainable growing tech company! You'll be part of an enthusiastic, highly motivated team of 650+ international Catawikians; you'll have big responsibilities and can really create something. Additionally you can expect:

An attractive Stock Option package
A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.
Catawiki provides you with a membership to the O'Reilly learning platform.
As part of Catawiki's goal to create a healthy and happy culture, we've partnered with Headspace, a global leader in mindfulness and meditation! We provide our employees with a free one-year subscription for Headspace.
Work from home office set-up to make sure you have all you need in an ergonomically-friendly manner.
A bike scheme for employees that helps realise a tax advantage which makes a bike up to 35% cheaper than buying!
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You'll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.
For people living outside of NL we offer a great relocation package for you and your family
The fun part! Our Activity Committee plans everything from 'CataFooty' to International Food Festivals, Friday Drinks, Board Game Nights, Pub Quizzes and Boot Camps!
And there's more! Paid holidays, Holiday Allowance, a discount on health insurance and a fantastic pension plan paid for by Catawiki.

For successful applicants who end up being hired, we always ensure a safe, engaging, and (for the time being) remote onboarding experience.

Outside of The Netherlands, we are able to employ people to work remotely in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium.

A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.

As part of Catawiki's goal to create a healthy and happy culture, we've partnered with Headspace, a global leader in mindfulness and meditation! We provide our employees with a free one-year subscription for Headspace.
Work from home office set-up to make sure you have all you need in an ergonomically-friendly manner.
A bike scheme for employees that helps realise a tax advantage which makes a bike up to 35% cheaper than buying!
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You'll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.
For people living outside of NL we offer a great relocation package for you and your family

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every single day. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone.

In fact, 10 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent.

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 650+ Catawikians working across 7 International offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

How we work

As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a domain which brings plenty of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, mostly written in Ruby, to handle the high volume of requests served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, Continuous Delivery, A/B testing every assumption and using the observability and monitoring tools already in place. We make mistakes and learn valuable lessons from them. Our focus is to be able to recover and iterate quickly.

What you'll do

Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other members of the Development team, you will build scalable microservices while measuring and monitoring system performance. In addition, you will use experimentation, backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.

What you'll bring

We look for engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby and some Golang, however, if you're passionate about learning new things then prior experience with Ruby or Go is not essential. Next to this:

You have experience in designing, implementing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and consistency.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on customers.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you've got a story to tell, come and join us.

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every single day. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone.

In fact, 10 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent.

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 650+ Catawikians working across 7 International offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

How we work

As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a domain which brings plenty of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, mostly written in Ruby, to handle the high volume of requests served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, Continuous Delivery, A/B testing every assumption and using the observability and monitoring tools already in place. We make mistakes and learn valuable lessons from them. Our focus is to be able to recover and iterate quickly.

What you'll do

Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other members of the Development team, you will build scalable microservices while measuring and monitoring system performance. In addition, you will use experimentation, backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.

What you'll bring

We look for engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby and some Golang, however, if you're passionate about learning new things then prior experience with Ruby or Go is not essential. Next to this:

You have experience in designing, implementing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and consistency.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on customers.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you've got a story to tell, come and join us.

Working and hiring remotely
As we navigate through the Covid19 pandemic together, we want to reassure you that keeping candidates and our employees safe is of paramount importance to us. That's why the entire recruitment process will take place remotely, using phone and video calls. For successful applicants who end up being hired, we always ensure a safe, engaging, and (for the time being) remote onboarding experience. When it is safe to do so, Catawiki will be implementing a hybrid work policy where employees based in the Netherlands will work from the office once per week and from home for the rest. Outside of The Netherlands, we are able to employ people to work remotely in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Belgium.

Here's what we can offer you
This is your chance to become part of a fast but sustainable growing tech company! You'll be part of an enthusiastic, highly motivated team of 650+ international Catawikians; you'll have big responsibilities and can really create something. Additionally you can expect:
