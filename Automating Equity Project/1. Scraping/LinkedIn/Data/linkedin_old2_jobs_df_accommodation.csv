'Research', 'Hospital & Health Care']","The Electronic Systems ES group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology TUe seeks to hire an outstanding PhD candidate within the field of remote vital signs monitoring, , Project Description, , Commoditization of digital cameras in visibile, nIR and thermal infrared spectral ranges has led to the discovery of a relatively large variety of techniques to measure physiological parameters in an entirely contactless manner, using these cameras Within the UMOSA project we will explore two contactless techniques, namely speckle vibrometry and remote thermography because each has a unique measurement principle, and consequently, they provide a relatively broad range of complementary physiological parameters, , In this PhD project, you will investigate how remote thermography rTG can be used for sleep monitoring Nasal air flow is a standard measurement in polysomnography and is typically done with oronasal thermistors which are cumbersome to wear To address this problem, the usefulness of rTG sleep monitoring has been already been demonstrated but measurement continuity is often compromised due to obfuscation of the nasal area by blankets, masks or simply because the patient turns her face away Current thermal cameras are rather expensive so a multiple camera solution is not preferred Also, thermal cameras often have relatively large viewing angles to increase the chance that the face is in view As result, the small nasal area is imaged poorly and the measurement is qualitative rather than quantitative To address these drawbacks, you need to develop in this PhD project a narrow field rTG device which could be placed at several locationviewing angles guaranteeing continuous nostril visibility and hereby solving the main limitation preventing the use of rTG in continuous remote vital signs monitoring, , , The Electronic Systems ES group within the Department of

sleep patients The ultimate goal is to detect and quantify the severity of sleep apnea using such remote monitoring techniques To be able to differentiate between obstructive and central apnea, respiratory effort and airflow have to be measured simultaneously To this end you will combine and extend existing camera based remote thermography rTG and remote PPG techniques One of the major challenges in building real world systems based on these remote sensing principles lays in the detection of the relevant body parts ie, nostrils, skin, chest while the patient is partially covered with sheets and might be turning around while sleeping For this purpose novel AIbased detection and tracking algorithms need to be developed Your PhD project should result in a technical demonstrator that is validated in a real sleep clinic with real patients, , , The Electronic Systems group consists of seven full professors, ten assistant professors, several postdocs, about 40 PDEng and PhD candidates and support staff The ES group is worldrenowned for its design automation and embedded systems research It is our ambition to provide a scientific basis for design trajectories of electronic systems, ranging from digital circuits to cyberphysical systems The trajectories are constructive and lead to high quality, costeffective systems with predictable properties functionality, timing, reliability, power dissipation, and cost Design trajectories for applications that have strict realtime requirements and stringent power constraints are an explicit focus point of the group Within this area, profdrir G de Haan and drir S Stuijk have developed various novel remote vital signs monitoring algorithms and their embedded implementations, , The UMOSA project team is designed to combine extensive knowledge in the key fields The project team includes partners from Philips and the Kempenhaeghe sleep hospital As part of this project, the PhD candidate will work closely with

Netherlands","['Higher Education', 'Research', 'Hospital & Health Care']","The ICT postmaster designers program is a twoyear salaried program in the field of technological design in Electrical Engineering The program leads to a Professional Doctorate in Engineering PDEng degree, , Project Description, , An important part of the PDEng programme is the design project which will be performed at Oc technologies The project is spread over two years and aims to develop your design engineers abilities In the project, a specific design objective must be reached within a restricted period of time and with limited means In accordance with the supervising professor the candidate will be given the opportunity to gather specialized knowledge for the design project already in the first year of your Traineeship You will be coached by experienced design engineers from industry andor by TUe staff with clear and relevant design experience You will acquire independence and learn to make choices and work well in a projectbased manner, , Canon Production Printing develops several highend digital inkjet printer systems for the highvolume and graphic arts professional printing markets Here, the demands on print quality are stringent, ie, no print quality artefacts and consistent good quality prints at high speed with little to no downtime of the printing system Print quality depends on precisely jetting ink droplets on moving media eg paper, how the image is subsequently formed by interactions between droplets and the media, and finally the ink solidification process Hence, many mechanical, physical and chemical interaction processes play a role in creating a high quality print, , Each printer has a printer health management architecture which attempts to ensure constant printing quality Currently, nearrealtime acoustic wave sensing is applied to establish the condition of jetting nozzles Decision tree analysis of the acoustic impulse response results in a known nozzle status and an estimation of the print quality, , Canon Production Printing is working on nextgeneration printer health architecture Therefore, an advanced imaging sensor is under development to provide realtime data on print quality in addition to the acoustic measurements Both methods result in large amounts of data that are excellently suited to be classified by deep learning algorithms eg, convolutional neural network Due to the many variables governing the print quality and expected availability of sensor data, application of deep learning classification to acoustic and imaging data is necessary, , This PDEng project will consist of deep learning algorithm development, simulation of print quality artifacts on a virtual printer and handson experimentation on printing systems, , For acoustic data, deep learning can be applied directly to the existing datasets The goal is to replace the decision tree classification process with a deep learning classification algorithm, , In case of the imaging sensor creating a representative training set of high quality using a real printer is infeasible Not only from the perspective of the time that would be needed, but also because it is difficult to reproduce many of the relevant print quality artifacts with a real printer In order to obtain training sets the candidate will use a virtual printer model to create a suitable highquality training set based on simulation data and subsequently train a deep learning model for print artifact detection The effectiveness of the deep learning model will be tested using real printer data obtained using the scanning system, , The result of both approaches would be a closed loop print quality control for future printing systems, , , , Eindhoven University of Technology TUe

any member of staff, but helping alongside them, whilst learning new skills, , , , The project is located in the north of the Caribbean province of Limn, 1km north of the Pacuare River Mouth The beach is part of the 50km coastline stretching between Tortuguero National Park and the port of Limn, one of the biggest ports of Costa Rica This is the home of this programme The international NGO running this project has been working for nearly together with scientists, conservationists and educators to promote sustainable sea turtle projects in the wider Caribbean region, , This conservation project works together with the of Pacuare Former poachers have been trained in sea turtle conservation and work together with volunteers to protect these critically endangered animals The project does and  Volunteers take an important part in Pacuare, as their fees generate an income for the local inhabitants The project strives to increase alternative livelihoods for coastal communities to take the need for poaching and hunting turtles away and to achieve a sea turtle management, , The main threats to sea turtles on this public beach are caused by humans nesting turtles are contributing to a population decline of all species Especially in the Caribbean, the consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs or the utilization of turtle shell for jewelry production is rooted in longlived local traditions and a strong belief that sea turtle eggs serve as an aphrodisiac On top of these dangers, sea turtles also face the and contamination, which results in nest and habitat loss due to beach erosion or entanglement in fishing gear and trash Through the involvement of local inhabitants of this very isolated, small community, the Pacuare sea turtle project provides not only a unique opportunity for volunteers to experience a Costa Rican conservation project but also offers a legal and sustainable revenue for community members The data taken from nesting females improves our understanding of their behaviour and helps coordinating conservation efforts worldwide, , Daily Life, , , , It is important to remember that sea turtles always come first This may mean working long, hard hours under hot and humid conditions but in the end, it is worth it, , A group of volunteers, led by an experienced patrol leader, walks one of the sectors of the 71km long beach searching for nesting females An average night patrol will take 4 hours but can last longer in case of sea turtle encounters Once a turtle is encountered on a night patrol, the volunteers work directly with it, taking carapace and nest dimension measurements, collecting eggs and collecting data The collected eggs will be relocated on the beach or taken to the hatchery where the volunteers on shift will build a new nest and rebury the eggs The number of eggs, nest location and turtle identification information tag number are then recorded by the hatchery attendant for further data analysis, for example determining hatchling survival rate, , This project applies a nonconfrontation policy with poachers while patrolling the beach Encounters with poachers are likely during turtle season but no communication or interference has proven to be the best way of dealing with illegal activities, as we are a conservation organization and not the police, , , , The main tasks in the hatchery will be relocating nests as described above and after having had thorough training, monitoring nests, keeping predators out ants, crabs, dogs, taking temperatures and measurements and releasing hatchlings The approximate incubation time for all sea turtle eggs is 60 days, therefore midway through the season the duties of the hatchery volunteer increase as the hatchlings begin to emerge At this time, all nests in the hatcheries must be checked every 20 minutes during day and night If hatchlings are encountered, they must be counted and released in the evening to an appropriate location along the high tide line and observed until they reach the sea All work must be done according to standard protocols and rules and only after receiving training, , , , Day time work will be for more or less two hours in the mornings, and can include beach cleanups, or involvement in small projects, maintenance of the equipment, including initial construction of the hatcheries amongst others, , all

literature since before the time of the ancient Greeks and was considered an omen of good luck It was sometimes even linked with the gods, to the extent that killing a dolphin equated killing another human and was punishable by death Their intelligence and friendly appearance has continued to inspire fascination for this enigmatic creature throughout the ages This close relationship has nonetheless never been an easy one and dolphins have been hunted for both their meat and skin throughout time Today they are competing with humans for the remaining fish stock of our seas and are increasingly forced out of their habitats Fishing equipment and boats are also a common cause of injury and death for dolphins worldwide, , There are four species of dolphins present in the Greek Seas, all of whom are considered threatened, yet no systematic research effort has been carried out so far to study their populations and ecology, , The Dolphin Research project programme aims to

to make a difference You will be immersed in a which is delivered via and numerous  We focus also on the which will prove immensely valuable when you go on to and further your career, , Founded in 2002, our Foundation has worked to establish sustainable practices throughout the Amazon True sustainability encompasses all areas of life in the rainforest people, plants and wildlife We take a which values  we look at real issues faced by local people and try to develop practical, sustainable alternatives We envision a sustainable Amazon where education and learning is the forefront for driving understanding and change The Amazon is under constant threat from many processes that cause habitat destruction such as logging, agriculture and mining Our sustainable initiative projects provide alternative forms of income that can help protect the rainforest as well as give people a livelihood This means that we help protect one of the most biodiverse places in the world, preventing the extinction of species, and other associated effects of rainforest destruction, such as climate change, , All our projects focus on two main areas which focuses directly on the rainforest, and where we work with local Communities The Manu Biosphere is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, with millions of species awaiting study, and numerous local communities living nearby, , In Manu we have a great opportunity to study conservation and biodiversity issues on micro and macro scales from endemic species of frogs that are not found anywhere else to a larger ecosystem approach By studying animal distribution and ecology on our reserve, looking at where they can be found, at what times and what weather conditions, we can begin to understand the relationship between the forest and the wildlife The people that live in Manu face issues of poverty, low education standards, malnutrition and lack of resources In trying to provide for their families, people can sometimes end up in dangerous, unsustainable jobs like slash and burn agriculture and illegal logging Our community projects were set up to investigate and provide alternative, safe, sustainable ways to earn their money and feed their families, , Research, , The Amazon is a delicately balanced ecosystem, however, human destruction of the rainforest is happening at such an alarming rate that these pristine environments are being systematically destroyed, , , , So what happens when a patch of destroyed rainforest is left alone, when the jungle is allowed to reclaim it and life slowly returns Our project is uniquely placed to investigate this, as for many years now our reserve has been naturally regenerating from when it was once farmland, , Our biodiversity monitoring plan is investigating the value of regenerating tropical rainforest for biodiversity and how species move back to forest that has a history of human disturbance This is the challenge we have set ourselves to answer through the Research Monitoring Programme, which is run in partnership with leading universities such as the University of Glasgow and Oxford University By developing longterm comparative studies we can understand how forests regenerate that have experienced different types and levels of disturbance We examine how the diversity of life can return if we promote and nurture successful rainforest regeneration As agricultural and industrial activities move into new areas to exploit, the biological value of regenerating forests is becoming increasingly important and our studies aim to investigate this, , Our scientific research programme has 3 main areas of focus, , As an intern, you will work alongside our field staff with the investigations that will answer these questions, , Mascotania Macaw monitoring programme, , The blueheaded macaw is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, meaning it is threatened with extinction The blueheaded macaw lives in a very specific habitat and so is heavily affected by deforestation and other human disturbances Their numbers are further damaged by exploitation for the pet trade, a growing problem in Peru, , So far we have found a decrease in the number of blueheaded macaws on the reserve over the past few years, correlating with an increase in tourist numbers Our aim is to successfully understand their behaviour and to educate tourists about responsible bird watching You will be involved in this by helping to monitor the number of blueheaded macaws visiting our clay lick at dawn as well as noting their activity, and recording the impacts of tourism on the birds, , Avian monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Bird species composition and diversity can signify many different things about the forest, such as forest type, structure, age, health, and level and type of human impact Hunting pressure and habitat fragmentation through roads and deforestation can largely affect bird populations For example, healthy populations of game birds such as guans, tinamous and trumpeters indicate low to zero hunting pressure, whilst the presence of a highly specialist species such as the harpy eagle may indicate undisturbed primary forest Not only is the ecology of many of these tropical foothill species poorly known, but the true value of regenerating forest for birds is understudied We conduct early morning transects along the reserve to listen and look for birds, , Butterfly monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , There are currently more than 550 known species of butterfly at the reserve Butterflies are significant bioindicators as well as pollinators for many plant species, which makes understanding their distribution throughout the forest, species density and fluctuations over time, a significant research project for us Butterfly larvae have highly specialised diets, so we can learn about the vegetation in each part of the forest by looking at the species we find in them, and by comparing our findings in each forest type we can see what effect regenerating forest has on species distribution, , You will be involved in setting up butterfly traps and bait, identifying them and recording new species to the reserve Butterflies teach us a lot about the forest and the changes that take place within it We are working on producing a comprehensive guide for visitors to the reserve, , Amphibian and reptile monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , Amphibians are excellent indicator species as they are extremely vulnerable to changes in their environment They have very thin skin which they use for gas exchange, and this makes them very sensitive to chemical pollutants and also to changes in climate eg temperature and humidity This means that they are one of the most important bioindicator species on the reserve, but it also means they are incredibly vulnerable, and are threatened by human activity the world over Studying the way they use regenerating forest is therefore vital for assessing its conservation value, , Mammal monitoring in different stages of forest regeneration, , In order to understand the importance of regenerating rainforest for mammal species, we have used a series of camera traps set up around the reserve to capture images of mammals in all three forest types So far more than 40 large mammal species have been recorded at the MLC, including 13 individual jaguar Due to the elusive nature of many mammal species the rest of our research is more adhoc You may find yourself unexpectedly tracking puma prints for half an hour, or trying to frantically count the number of peccaries that just crossed your path These encounters are vital to our understanding of the way mammals use regenerating forest, , Sustainable Community Initiatives, , We work with local communities in Manu to create sustainable income that meets the challenges faced by remote rainforest towns Poverty and lack of access to higher education in Manu forces many families into unsustainable work such as illegal logging, slash and burn agriculture, and mining Not only are these often dangerous and unhealthy, with little financial return, they also contribute to rainforest destruction To date our community projects have positively impacted more than 600 people, , Biogardens, , We work specifically with local mothers to combat malnutrition, by providing resources and knowledge to build biogardens that produce nutritious, fresh food for families, and extra income through surplus crops So far volunteers and local mothers have created over 60 family biogardens, and have helped build two institutional biogardens Since beginning our work with biogardens in 2009, this has resulted in an annual increase in income for the direct beneficiaries of biogardens, and an increase in child nutrition and health, , Agroforestry, , The agroforestry plots are planted with local farmers, and provide both short and longterm income through producing sustainable wood with banana production This is an environmentally sustainable livelihood that provides a sustainable alternative to illegal logging activities in the surrounding forest Agroforestry encourages species diversity, increases soil nutrition, and creates carbon credits that can be sold to further support the project, , We have helped turn more than 61 hectares of abandoned and degraded land into agroforestry plots, which have subsequently seen increased biodiversity, help plant over 10,000 banana trees, 7,000 hardwood and softwood trees, and created the first program in Peru to ever commercialise carbon credits on behalf of a local community sold to Oriel College Oxford University, , all information above is subject to

play a crucial role in the pollination of neotropical plants and are also extremely important in forest regeneration through seed dispersal They are also important natural controllers of the insect populations, many of which are responsible for disease transmission, , Previous research has shown that 50 of all endangered species of bats are island dwelling Island bats are the source of considerable concern for conservation as they are essential to the health of the natural world Unfortunately few people appreciate the importance of bats and many do not distinguish between the vampire bat and other species, often resulting in wanton destruction of shelters and unnecessary pursuit of these beneficial and harmless animals Bat reproductive rate is low compared to mammals of similar size so populations are slow to recover from losses, , Identifying the species present is the first step in understanding these mammals role in the island s ecosystems and evaluating any threats present to them The conservation of these fascinating creatures requires public education, so as well as the fieldwork, this project also includes developing our Bat Educational Outreach program for the schools and local community, , , , Utila spinytailed iguanas, Ctenosaura bakeri are endemic to the island of Utila This species has been listed as critically endangered, mainly due to its limited geographic range, increased habitat changes and destruction as well as overharvesting of adults and eggs, , This highly threatened species has been the focus of many conservation initiatives, including a captive breeding program and education program for schools Despite all these efforts the population is still in decline Utila has experienced extensive development associated with the tourist industry, threatening native species through habitat destruction, pollution and the introduction of invasive mammals and plants This development has had a dramatic effect on the beach and mangrove areas, as these are the most residentially desirable Unfortunately these areas are also the nesting grounds and daily use areas for C bakeri, , Another serious threat is the ongoing hunting for the iguana as a source of protein, a practice for many generations on Utila Unfortunately while it is illegal to hunt the C bakeri there is no active means of protection or enforcement, , Very little is known concerning the basic biology of this species The primary aims of this project are to examine, , This information is vital in understanding the status of the species and in the construction of a comprehensive conservation and management plan, , Iguanas will be caught measurements taken, transects will also be walked by scientists and volunteers to estimate abundance DNA samples will be taken from the Iguanas for a hybridization study at a university in the UK These projects are in conjunction with the IUCN Iguana Specialist Group, , , , The entomology fauna of Utila is very poorly known Therefore there is a real need to identify areas of high insect diversity The knowledge of insect diversity will helps us define which areas of Utila should be protected The island is being deforested at a rapid pace to make room for the construction of homes, hotels and roads By protecting the forests we are also able to protect other species that depend on this habitat and avoid the type of unsustainable tourism that is threatening the fauna and flora of Utila, , This study aims to understand the theory of island biogeography, dealing with the distribution and abundance of species on an island The value of insects as experimental animals provides an excellent window to understand how different populations, species, ecosystems and landscapes respond to inevitable changes, , Pollination is a widely understudied topic in Central America Habitats are being continually fragmented at a rapid rate Island populations are incredibly different from main land populations and the aim of the current study will be to determine what species of hymenoptera are here on the beautiful island of Utila, with Orchid Bees being the main focus Volunteers will get a chance to run around with insect nets, catching up all the hymenoptera they can find They will also learn different entomological preservation techniques and some different types of traps for various insects, , Field assistant activities will include helping set up and empty insect pitfall, daily checking of the traps, insect catching, insect preservation and identification, , , , 13 species of snake have been reported on Utila, however apart from these reports, no other research work has been done to determine whether or not other species are present on the island and whether all previously reported species are still present There is also a gap in our knowledge as to where each species can be found on the island It is important to investigate this to assess the possible impacts of the extensive development currently taking place on Utila If some species that occur are particularly rare, it could take only minor development of a small area of the island to eradicate the population Establishing more concretely which species occur on the island and where each of these populations can be found will be the primary aim of the study, , It is important these populations of species are identified and distributions mapped to prevent any catastrophic loss of snake diversity on the island Plotting the distribution and abundance of various species across the island is a primary research focus with the resulting maps being invaluable for considerate future development This will be done through methodical and systemized searches within predetermined sections of different habitats helping us to determine species habitat preferences, , , , Utila has very little in the way of true map resources Therefore a new project has been launched to map the island using GIS software and tools The aim of this project is to produce a map with several different layers The main layer will be a general map of the physical island, detailing paths, tracks and sites of general interest These maps will be made available online and accessible to the general public, , The other layers will hold more detailed information such as species locations and locations of various study sites This is environmentally sensitive information and will only be available to people with a legitimate reason after a formal request and will be used to further aid current and future research projects on the flora and fauna of Utila This project is currently on hold, but may restart again in the near future, , , , Tourism is exploding on Utila, bringing muchneeded income to maintain and improve the islands infrastructure and social institutions Unfortunately, it also creates a high potential for tourism development to take on socially and environmentally unsustainable practices, , This project aims to enhance existing science education on Utila, engage students in environmental conservation and hopefully inspire the future generation of working Utilans to protect their local ecosystems while developing tourism and other industries responsibly Increasing the awareness of the youngest generations about conservation issued on the island could contribute to an improvement of general behaviours and attitudes of all islanders towards their environment, , We will also provide opportunities for students to work with Kanahau scientists and develop research skills that may help them secure employment in the future, , The project will be delivered in collaboration with other NGOs present in the island BICA, WSORC, Iguana station to provide a fully comprehensive environmental program, , all information above is subject to change Please check the most up to date information on the Global Nomadic website when

enhanced rural resilience Project,9yEKpxuSTfuEhGKrPzuL6A==,UNDP  United Nations Development Programme,"Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands","['Nonprofit Organization Management', 'Management Consulting', 'Government Administration']","Considering its economic structure and geographic features, Moldova is highly vulnerable to climate change and is exposed to disasters due to the hydrometeorological phenomena and natural hazards While drought and floods are among top hydrometeorological hazards caused by extreme weather and climate events, due to the current and projected abnormal high temperatures leading to water scarcity the incidence of forest fires is increasingly posing a threat to the natural ecosystems, agricultural system and human settlements With the projected decrease in surface water availability by 1620 by 2020 due to climate change, the water supply for all users requires adaptation options to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities related to water stress In Moldovas climate induced disasters are occurring more frequently and on a recurring basis, causing an average of 4 million US dollars per year of economic damage, , Climate scenarios also indicate the country is trending strongly towards becoming more arid This will intensify not only droughts but also fires Unfortunately, rural communities experience a capacity deficit in terms of fire prevention, preparedness and timely response mainly due to liquidation of over 400 equipped and capacitated firefighting units following the extensive privatization process from the 90s Subsequently, the intervention radius of 3 km according to norms increased to up to 1015 km in urban areas and 4050 km in rural areas where 70 of the total number of fires occur It resulted in increased response time and lower awareness of fire risks by the rural population, subsequently leading to considerable increase in loss of life, material damages and affected ecosystems It is widely accepted that rural women are disproportionately affected by fires due to them being mostly engaged in cooking in unsafe cookstoves and collection of firewood in ecosystems that might be at high risk of fires Overall, during 2008 and 2017, in Moldova were registered about 8 725 fires resulting in 1 356 deaths, including 61 children In the rural areas, poor and lowincome households are mostly exposed to fire risks due to also lack of proper fire prevention measures and adapted techniques, education and awareness, , Against this background, the project aims to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of rural communities to climate change and disasters through improved water storage infrastructures and disasters risk reduction measures The project is supporting implementation of climatesmart water management solutions for agriculture, flood management and fire prevention and expansion of communitybased rescuefirefighting teams in rural communities of Moldova with the purpose to reduce the exposure and vulnerability of the rural communities to climate change and disaster risks The project will be implemented over a period of 36 months and the activities are

agricultural sectors by supporting with grants at least 15 farmers, including women, to put in place climatesmart water systems, such as for instance, water storage basins, , Under the 2d Output 2

'Financial Services']","The Electronic Systems ES group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology TUe seeks to hire an outstanding PhD candidate within the field of remote vital signs monitoring Project description Commoditization of digital cameras in visibile, nIR and thermal infrared spectral ranges has led to the discovery of a relatively large variety of techniques to measure physiological parameters in an entirely contactless manner, using these cameras Within the UMOSA project we will explore two contactless techniques, namely speckle vibrometry and remote thermography because each has a unique measurement principle, and consequently, they provide a relatively broad range of complementary physiological parametersIn this PhD project, you will investigate how remote thermography rTG can be used for sleep monitoring Nasal air flow is a standard measurement in polysomnography and is typically done with oronasal thermistors which are cumbersome to wear To address this problem, the usefulness of rTG sleep monitoring has been already been demonstrated but measurement continuity is often compromised due to obfuscation of the nasal area by blankets, masks or simply because the patient turns her face away Current thermal cameras are rather expensive so a multiple camera solution is not preferred Also, thermal cameras often have relatively large viewing angles to increase the chance that the face is in view As result, the small nasal area is imaged poorly and the measurement is qualitative rather than quantitative To address these drawbacks, you need to develop in this PhD project a narrow field rTG device which could be placed at several locationviewing angles guaranteeing continuous nostril visibility and hereby solving the main limitation preventing the use of rTG in continuous remote vital signs monitoring The Electronic Systems ES group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology TUe seeks to hire an outstanding PhD candidate within the field of remote vital signs monitoring Commoditization of digital cameras in visible, nIR and thermal infrared spectral ranges has led to the discovery of a relatively large variety of techniques to measure physiological parameters in an entirely contactless manner, using these cameras Within the UMOSA project we will explore two contactless techniques, namely speckle vibrometry and remote thermography because each has a unique measurement principle, and consequently, they provide a relatively broad range of complementary physiological parametersIn this PhD project, you will investigate how camera based monitoring can be used to monitor the respiratory flow in sleep patients The ultimate goal is to detect and quantify the severity of sleep apnea using such remote monitoring techniques To be able to differentiate between obstructive and central apnea, respiratory effort and airflow have to be measured simultaneously To this end you will combine and extend existing camera based remote thermography rTG and remote PPG techniques One of the major challenges in building real world systems based on these remote sensing principles lays in the detection of the relevant body parts ie, nostrils, skin, chest while the patient is partially covered with sheets and might be turning around while sleeping For this purpose novel AIbased detection and tracking algorithms need to be developed Your PhD project should result in a technical demonstrator that is validated in a real sleep clinic with real patients The Electronic Systems group consists of seven full professors, ten assistant professors, several postdocs, about 40 PDEng and PhD candidates and support staff The ES group is worldrenowned for its design automation and embedded systems research It is our ambition to provide a scientific basis for design trajectories of electronic systems, ranging from digital circuits to cyberphysical systems The trajectories are constructive and lead to high quality, costeffective systems with predictable properties functionality, timing, reliability, power dissipation, and cost Design trajectories for applications that have strict realtime requirements and stringent power constraints are an explicit focus point of the group Within this area, profdrir G de Haan and drir S Stuijk have developed various novel remote vital signs monitoring algorithms and their embedded implementationsThe UMOSA project team is designed to combine extensive knowledge in the key fields The project team includes partners from Philips and the Kempenhaeghe sleep hospital As part of this project, the PhD candidate will work closely with these partners to ensure that the developed techniques

metagenomics, proficiency in coding and a keen interest in symbiosis, archaea and evolution The position is offered for a minimum of three years, , , The research of the Department of Marine Microbiology and Biogeochemistry MMB has a long history of studying Archaea, especially their role in marine biogeochemical cycles as well as their membrane lipid biomarkers These are used both in the present but also in the past as fossilized lipid remnants to decipher past climate changes and to reconstruct microbial evolution, , The MMB department is also focused on the identity, activity and physiology of Archaea and other marine microbes, their interactions, and their role in biogeochemical cycling in a variety of marine environments, ranging from tidal flats and coral reefs to the deep ocean and sediments The department is equipped with stateoftheart laboratories, bioinformatics resources and analytical equipment, and has an excellent level of technical support, , The research team of Anja Spang, who recently was awarded an ERCstarting grant ASymbEL has a key interest in the role of symbiosis in the evolution of life on Earth ranging from the origin of the eukaryotic cell to symbiotic relationships between different extant microbial groups, including archaea The focus of her current research lies in the study of DPANN archaea, which represent a tentative archaeal superphylum comprising lineages with extremely small genomes and cell sizes, that includes the so far only parasitic members of the archaea, , , The recent application of metagenomics approaches to the study of microbial communities has greatly expanded our view on lifes diversity and led to the discovery of a large radiation of DPANN archaeal lineages with small genomes hypothesized to represent microbial symbionts The placement of these lineages in the tree of life has proven difficult, the exact reasons of which are poorly established so far Furthermore, nearly nothing is known about the impact of DPANN symbionts on biogeochemical nutrient cycles as well as microbial communities and in particular on the evolution of their hosts Integrated into the larger frame of ASymbEL, in this project we will investigate the microevolutionary impact of marine DPANN symbionts on their host populations and elucidate fundamental principles of their genome evolution using a variety of genomics approaches combined with microscopy and experimental evolution, , , , Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research NIOZ, , , , We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher

'Research', 'Financial Services']","The ICT postmaster designers program is a twoyear salaried program in the field of technological design in Electrical Engineering The program leads to a Professional Doctorate in Engineering PDEng degree Project description An important part of the PDEng programme is the design project which will be performed at Oc technologies The project is spread over two years and aims to develop your design engineers abilities In the project, a specific design objective must be reached within a restricted period of time and with limited means In accordance with the supervising professor the candidate will be given the opportunity to gather specialized knowledge for the design project already in the first year of your Traineeship You will be coached by experienced design engineers from industry andor by TUe staff with clear and relevant design experience You will acquire independence and learn to make choices and work well in a projectbased mannerCanon Production Printing develops several highend digital inkjet printer systems for the highvolume and graphic arts professional printing markets Here, the demands on print quality are stringent, ie, no print quality artefacts and consistent good quality prints at high speed with little to no downtime of the printing system Print quality depends on precisely jetting ink droplets on moving media eg paper, how the image is subsequently formed by interactions between droplets and the media, and finally the ink solidification process Hence, many mechanical, physical and chemical interaction processes play a role in creating a high quality printEach printer has a printer health management architecture which attempts to ensure constant printing quality Currently, nearrealtime acoustic wave sensing is applied to establish the condition of jetting nozzles Decision tree analysis of the acoustic impulse response results in a known nozzle status and an estimation of the print qualityCanon Production Printing is working on nextgeneration printer health architecture Therefore, an advanced imaging sensor is under development to provide realtime data on print quality in addition to the acoustic measurements Both methods result in large amounts of data that are excellently suited to be classified by deep learning algorithms eg, convolutional neural network Due to the many variables governing the print quality and expected availability of sensor data, application of deep learning classification to acoustic and imaging data is necessaryThis PDEng project will consist of deep learning algorithm development, simulation of print quality artifacts on a virtual printer and handson experimentation on printing systemsFor acoustic data, deep learning can be applied directly to the existing datasets The goal is to replace the decision tree classification process with a deep learning classification algorithmIn case of the imaging sensor creating a representative training set of high quality using a real printer is infeasible Not only from the perspective of the time that would be needed, but also because it is difficult to reproduce many of the relevant print quality artifacts with a real printer In order to obtain training sets the candidate will use a virtual printer model to create a suitable highquality training set based on simulation data and subsequently train a deep learning model for print artifact detection The effectiveness of the deep learning model will be tested using real printer data obtained using the scanning systemThe result of both approaches would be a closed loop print quality control for future printing systems Eindhoven University of Technology TUe is a worldleading research university specializing in

Netherlands","['Higher Education', 'Research', 'Mechanical or Industrial Engineering']","Job description The ICT postmaster designers program is a twoyear salaried program in the field of technological design in Electrical Engineering The program leads to a Professional Doctorate in Engineering PDEng degree, , Project Description, , An important part of the PDEng programme is the design project which will be performed at Oc technologies The project is spread over two years and aims to develop your design engineers abilities In the project, a specific design objective must be reached within a restricted period of time and with limited means In accordance with the supervising professor the candidate will be given the opportunity to gather specialized knowledge for the design project already in the first year of your Traineeship You will be coached by experienced design engineers from industry andor by TUe staff with clear and relevant design experience You will acquire independence and learn to make choices and work well in a projectbased manner, , Canon Production Printing develops several highend digital inkjet printer systems for the highvolume and graphic arts professional printing markets Here, the demands on print quality are stringent, ie, no print quality artefacts and consistent good quality prints at high speed with little to no downtime of the printing system Print quality depends on precisely jetting ink droplets on moving media eg paper, how the image is subsequently formed by interactions between droplets and the media, and finally the ink solidification process Hence, many mechanical, physical and chemical interaction processes play a role in creating a high quality print, , Each printer has a printer health management architecture which attempts to ensure constant printing quality Currently, nearrealtime acoustic wave sensing is applied to establish the condition of jetting nozzles Decision tree analysis of the acoustic impulse response results in a known nozzle status and an estimation of the print quality, , Canon Production Printing is working on nextgeneration printer health architecture Therefore, an advanced imaging sensor is under development to provide realtime data on print quality in addition to the acoustic measurements Both methods result in large amounts of data that are excellently suited to be classified by deep learning algorithms eg, convolutional neural network Due to the many variables governing the print quality and expected availability of sensor data, application of deep learning classification to acoustic and imaging data is necessary, , This PDEng project will consist of deep learning algorithm development, simulation of print quality artifacts on a virtual printer and handson experimentation on printing systems, , For acoustic data, deep learning can be applied directly to the existing datasets The goal is to replace the decision tree classification process with a deep learning classification algorithm, , In case of the imaging sensor creating a representative training set of high quality using a real printer is infeasible Not only from the perspective of the time that would be needed, but also because it is difficult to reproduce many of the relevant print quality artifacts with a real printer In order to obtain training sets the candidate will use a virtual printer model to create a suitable highquality training set based on simulation data and subsequently train a deep learning model for print artifact detection The effectiveness of the deep learning model will be tested using real printer data obtained using the scanning system, , The result of both approaches would be a closed loop print quality control for future printing systems, , , , Eindhoven University of Technology TUe is a worldleading research university specializing in engineering science  technology The Department of Electrical Engineering is responsible for research and
