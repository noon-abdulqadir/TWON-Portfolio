Frontires","Location":"Rotterdam, South Holland, Netherlands","Industry":"['Nonprofit Organization Management', 'Health, Wellness and Fitness', 'Hospital & Health Care']","Job Description":"The Terms of Reference can be downloaded as a PDF , , MEDICAL HUMANITARIAN CONTEXT, , Adolescents 1019 years old comprise 233 of the total Zimbabwean population1 Among the many health challenges faced by this group, Sexual and Reproductive Health SRH, and more concretely teenage pregnancy, is of great concern The Demographic and Health Survey conducted by Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency in 2015 found that 216 of girls between 1519 years old had begun childbearing in Zimbabwe, and 122 in Harare2 About 36 of the overall pregnancies among adolescents in Zimbabwe were reported as unplanned being of concern that in most cases these pregnancies resulted in induced abortions generally performed under unsafe conditions3 In fact, about 10 of all pregnancies to Zimbabwean teenage girls end up in unsafe abortions UNFPA, 2016 The existing legal frame at country level ie, legal age of consent is 16 years contraceptive education and access is not allowed in schools seems to play, together with other factors, an important role in terms of barriers to SRH care for young people in Zimbabwe Vulnerable young people are often disadvantaged from many health programs, , Mbare is the oldest and one of the most densely populated suburbs of Harare It was established in 1907 as a dormitory suburb for the working community during colonial era of Zimbabwe The suburb is highly accessible from most parts of the country and has a hive of activities The context gives the population unique characteristics that include high mobility, overcrowding and poor socioeconomic status leading to risky behaviours and higher vulnerabilities for adolescents and young people According to the 2012 Demographic Health Survey, Mbare is estimated to have a population of between 84,168 and 142,195 with 60 of them aged between 1024 years, , As specific SRH needs for adolescents were identified during a genderbased sexual violence project run by MSF in Mbare, the organization decided in 2015 to initiate another project specifically targeting adolescents4 Its general objective is to reduce the morbidity and mortality for adolescents in Mbare and surrounding areas by improving access to an adolescentfriendly SRH package of care Its specific objective aims at piloting innovative and replicable models of SRH, HIV and TB prevention and care for adolescents, which could lead to policy changes, , The project targets three subgroups of adolescents teenagers from poor socioeconomic context, adolescents at higher risk adolescents from key populations5, homeless adolescents and adolescents with disabilities, and adolescents living with HIV SRH services of the project cover three areas contraceptive care, antenatal care and postabortion care6, in addition to STI screening and treatment HIV services include prevention, ProviderInitiated Counseling and Testing PICT, selftesting, antiretroviral treatment including differentiated service delivery models and management of Opportunistic Infections OI In addition, other medical services were offered such as Primary Health Care PHC, Mental Health MH care, and psychosocial support in an adolescent friendly environment, , In terms of project activities, MSF is involved in the direct provision of sexual and reproductive care to adolescents in Mbare PolyClinic In addition, MSF rehabilitated parts of Matapi satellite clinic It is also currently running there a nonmedicalized youth hub offering health education, contraceptive care and income generation activities in partnership with other organizations At community level, MSF activities include Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health ASRH health promotion and education initiatives ie, School Health Clubs, and strategies to link and retain in care adolescents living with HIV and young people ie, mobile clinics to hotspots Some of these activities are conducted with the involvement of peer educators MSF also conducts capacity building activities for health staff of the City of Harare, , Since January 2016, a total of 16,500 adolescent beneficiaries received medical care in the facilities supported by MSF in Mbare From January 2019 to the end of September 2020, 102 adolescents received postabortion care 6,344 adolescents were sensitized through community peertopeer interventions In addition, two SRH digital health promotion campaigns were carried out, reaching 630,020 persons A roundtable with key MSF stakeholders is planned for the second trimester of 2021, to discuss the main project orientations for the next years, , REASON FOR EVALUATION  RATIONALE, , While adolescents represent a part of patients cohorts in MSF projects, the MSF experience in targeting them exclusively is quite limited This project represents a unique opportunity for MSF to reflect and learn about the specific enabling factors and challenges of adolescents health interventions, , The project strategy relies strongly on partnerships and collaborations with other actors including the delivery of health services This component of its strategy represents an additional element of interest, to be assessed and reflected, , OVERALL OBJECTIVE AND INTENDED USE, , OVERALL OBJECTIVE is to assess the appropriateness, effectiveness, coverage, and connectedness of the MSF adolescent SRH intervention in Mbare and to identify the necessary adaptations for the next years, , INTENDED USE of this evaluation is aimed primarily at informing MSF Operational Centre Brussels OCB discussions to take place during the second quarter of 2021 about the projects main orientations for the next years, including potential necessary adaptations It may also be used by MSF and other actors potentially interested in reflecting on how to adequately address adolescents health in similar projects, , SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES, , , EFFECTIVENESS, , , COVERAGE, ,  To which extent do the medical activities reach the target population globally as well as more specifically to each subgroup,  Are there any factors that hinder project ability to reach the target populations and those most in need,  To what extent do beneficiaries have access to medical services provided by this project What are the main enabling factors to facilitate this access Is any targeted group excluded from the services provided by this project, , CONNECTEDNESS, , , EXPECTED DELIVERABLES, , , TOOLS AND METHODOLOGY PROPOSED, , In addition to the initial evaluation proposal submitted as a part of the application, a detailed evaluation protocol should be prepared by the evaluators during the inception phase It will include a detailed explanation of proposed methods and its justification based on validated theoryies It will be reviewed and validated as a part of the inception phase in coordination with SEU, , The evaluation should ensure diverse perspectives and make explicit the experiences and values of the different stakeholders, not least those affected by the intervention and the partners, , RECOMMENDED DOCUMENTATION, ,  Project documents project proposals, logical frameworks, situational reports, annual reports, field visit reports,,  MSF

to appoint a fulltime PhD candidate to carry out research 75 and teaching 25 activities on radicalisation and antigovernment extremism, , Over the past several years, a heterogeneous protest movement has been developing that defies easy categorization into political or religious ideological categories Rather than belonging clearly to the political right or left, being religiously inspired or focused on singleissue topics, this protest movement is perhaps best defined by its eclectic nature In its focus, this developing form of antigovernment extremism mixes a variety politicallyideological fragments, such as antiglobalist critique from the left and antiimmigration stances from the right, with conspiracy thinking and idiosyncratic motives, including grievances against particular governmental institutions as well as grievances driven by poor mental health In its appearance, this eclecticism is reflected in online and offline elements, large protests as well as loneactor activity Forms of expression also differ widely, from civil disobedience and activism to intimidation, streetlevel violence and even terrorism, , This protest movement also brings together a range of new actors alongside a core of wellknown activists, including people newly drawn to antigovernment themes through social media, and novel categories such as influencers In terms of family resemblance, some core themes can be drawn from this difficult to define movement A deep mistrust of the institutions of liberal societies eg government, media, science, experts, a conviction that democratic freedoms are purposefully being squandered, and the belief that the government is the enemy of the people Among policymakers in the Netherlands, this new protest movement is being discussed in terms of antigovernment extremism The phenomenon is not limited to the Netherlands In the United States, for instance, targeted violence has recently been added as a threat to the national counterterrorism strategy as distinct from more classic and wellknown forms of ideologically driven violence, , The PhD candidate will be supervised by Dr Edwin Bakker, promotor and Dr Jelle

a project aiming at developing a novel and innovative epigenomic method that will assist the translation of epigenomic findings to the clinic and court, , Human epigenomic research has yielded numerous biomarkers predictive of personalized health and diseaserelated outcomes, such as in cancer diagnosis and management These personalized signatures can also be useful for specialized nonmedical applications, such as in forensics Over the years, epigenetic biomarker discovery has become possible via DNA methylation microarrays for epigenomewide screening of hundreds of thousands of biomarkers CpG sites, provided that the analysed DNA is of sufficiently high quantity and quality, which in many clinical and forensic applications it is not Therefore, clinical and forensic epigenomic applications have suffered thus far from smallscale targeted tests no more than 2030 CpG fragments, despite the need of many more CpGs to address these questions Currently, translation in epigenomic applications has come to a halt due to the lack of suitable largescale targeted methods, in terms of sensitivity, multiplex capability, flexibility, and costs, , In this project, we aim to tackle this major and timely technical limitation by developing and thoroughly testing a new method for the simultaneous targeted analysis of hundreds to thousands of CpGs, preselected for different applications We aim to achieve this via novel technological innovation that will allow for tailored and largescale targeted epigenomic testing from just 1001,000 cells, typically obtained in clinical settings that use liquid and need biopsies, but also in forensics that deal with trace evidence from crime scenes The project will include method development, thorough validation and direct application to selected clinical and forensic questions, , As a PhD student you will be part of an interdisciplinary research group working in the field of applied epigenomics You will directly be responsible for the development, optimization, validation and testing of the proposed novel and innovative method, which includes both laboratory and computational tools It is therefore essential that you have experience and expertise with both wet and drylab analysis methods Evidence of a deep understanding of prior research topics and of independent intellectual and practical contributions to previous research projects will be considered as good indicators that such attributes can be brought into the present project This position also entails close collaborative and interdisciplinary work involving other departments at Erasmus MC and international partners For eventually fulfilling the PhD requirements at Erasmus MC, several firstauthor publications in international peerreviewed scientific journals are required together with education achievements within the 4year PhD period, , , , The vision of the Department of Genetic Identification is to improve the safety of the society and to enhance the quality of life via outcomes of fundamental and applied research in human epigenetics, epigenomics and molecular biology Using genetic identification as the key principle, we perform innovative research and technological developments in a wide range of societally relevant areas in human life sciences, including forensics, legal medicine, evolution, epidemiology and in other medically relevant fields Together with several fundamental research departments, the Department of Genetic Identification is embedded within the Biomedical Science Theme Towards our mission, we collaborate with several nonclinical departments at Erasmus MC and research institutions worldwide, , , , Being able to present a certificate of good conduct, a valid proof of identity, diplomas and or relevant registration such as BIG RGS are conditions for the appointment, , Before you apply please check our conditions for employment, , , , You will receive a temporary position for 4 years with evaluation for continuation after the first year The gross monthly salary is  2,494 in the 1st year and increases to  3,196 in the 4th year scale OIO The terms of employment are according to the

Netherlands","Industry":"['Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Hospital & Health Care']","Job Description":"Job description We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic PhD student to contribute to our recently funded research within the Applied Epigenomics group of the Department of Genetic Identification at Erasmus MC, led by Dr Athina Vidaki The successful applicant will work on a project aiming at developing a novel and innovative epigenomic method that will assist the translation of epigenomic findings to the clinic and court Human epigenomic research has yielded numerous biomarkers predictive of personalized health and diseaserelated outcomes, such as in cancer diagnosis and management These personalized signatures can also be useful for specialized nonmedical applications, such as in forensics Over the years, epigenetic biomarker discovery has become possible via DNA methylation microarrays for epigenomewide screening of hundreds of thousands of biomarkers CpG sites, provided that the analysed DNA is of sufficiently high quantity and quality, which in many clinical and forensic applications it is not Therefore, clinical and forensic epigenomic applications have suffered thus far from smallscale targeted tests no more than 2030 CpG fragments, despite the need of many more CpGs to address these questions Currently, translation in epigenomic applications has come to a halt due to the lack of suitable largescale targeted methods, in terms of sensitivity, multiplex capability, flexibility, and costs In this project, we aim to tackle this major and timely technical limitation by developing and thoroughly testing a new method for the simultaneous targeted analysis of hundreds to thousands of CpGs, preselected for different applications We aim to achieve this via novel technological innovation that will allow for tailored and largescale targeted epigenomic testing from just 1001,000 cells, typically obtained in clinical settings that use liquid and need biopsies, but also in forensics that deal with trace evidence from crime scenes The project will include method development, thorough validation and direct application to selected clinical and forensic questions As a PhD student you will be part of an interdisciplinary research group working in the field of applied epigenomics You will directly be responsible for the development, optimization, validation and testing of the proposed novel and innovative method, which includes both laboratory and computational tools It is therefore essential that you have experience and expertise with both wet and drylab analysis methods Evidence of a deep understanding of prior research topics and of independent intellectual and practical contributions to previous research projects will be considered as good indicators that such attributes can be brought into the present project This position also entails close collaborative and interdisciplinary work involving other departments at Erasmus MC and international partners For eventually fulfilling the PhD requirements at Erasmus MC, several firstauthor publications in international peerreviewed scientific journals are required together with education achievements within the 4year PhD period, , Work environment The vision of the Department of Genetic Identification is to improve the safety of the society and to enhance the quality of life via outcomes of fundamental and applied research in human epigenetics, epigenomics and molecular biology Using genetic identification as the key principle, we perform innovative research and technological developments in a wide range of societally relevant areas in human life sciences, including forensics, legal medicine, evolution, epidemiology and in other medically relevant fields Together with several fundamental research departments, the Department of Genetic Identification is embedded within the Biomedical Science Theme Towards our mission, we collaborate
