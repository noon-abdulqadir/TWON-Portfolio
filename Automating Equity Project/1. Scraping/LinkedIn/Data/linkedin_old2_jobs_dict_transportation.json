Brabant, Netherlands","Industry":"['Higher Education', 'Research', 'Hospital & Health Care']","Job Description":"General, The design of dynamical systems is a cornerstone discipline within Mechanical Engineering and industry needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design process, , , Shaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which eg has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models that, , and matching numerical simulation and dynamic analysis tools that support design decisions and design optimization These multiphysics modelling and dynamic analysis tools can then 1 be employed as a platform in which interdisciplinary design tradeoffs can be made explicit and on which early design decisions can be based and 2 serve as collaborative platforms for multidisciplinary engineering design teams The ultimate goal is to exploit these tools for the development of novel design concepts for the futures engineering systems and processes, providing solutions to societal challenges on energy, health, food, etc, , This research theme provides ample opportunity for fundamental, interdisciplinary research and valorization in a wide range of applications, many of which are strongly rooted in the Dutch hightech  manufacturing industry, and the agriculture and transportation sectors, , , , , , The Department of Mechanical

challenges and trends in the abovementioned areas, , Candidates who apply are expected to have a solid background on at least two of the core disciplines mentioned above More importantly, the candidate should aspire to function in a multidisciplinary research environment The candidate should have the ambition set up a strong, internationally renowned research group, while fostering a collaborative network with other academics working on the topic within the department, the university and industry The candidate should contribute to the progress in the field of modelbased dynamical systems design, in order to be able to meet the future demands on engineering system design in industry and society, , , The candidate will contribute to the existing BSc program Mechanical
