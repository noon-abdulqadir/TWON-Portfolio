A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across extraordinary objects such as these every day.

The special object you've been searching for, or a new and unexpected interest you never thought you'd have: the more you look, the more you'll find. And at Catawiki, there's always more to the story. Our experts value, authenticate and curate everything from automobiles to vintage stamps, so everything you encounter is real and layered with meaning - waiting to be found.

Our mission is to connect passionate enthusiasts with the objects that tell their stories. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, we help over 10 million people discover new treasures every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent! Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 and have since grown to over 650 Catawikians, working across 7 international offices, while maintaining our start-up mentality every step of the way.

Work with the Recruitment, Marketing & Comms Teams to refine Catawiki's EVP
Help create awareness about Catawiki's EVP by creating and sharing relevant content across our different careers channels (Linkedin, Careers Website, Twitter, Youtube etc)
Create Catawiki's employer branding content calendar and schedule
Create engaging content across different mediums (Photo, Video, Podcast, Blogpost etc) and experiment with different ideas, using data to see what works best.
Develop internal engagement activities to help all Catawikians become brand ambassadors.
Rebuild and maintain the Catawiki ""Jobs Website"" to bring it more in line with the company and culture we represent today.

Who you are

3-5 years Marketing experience in fast paced environments combined with demonstrable experience in building out an attractive Employer Brand for a fast growing business
Experience setting up inspiring and effective digital marketing campaigns
Experience with creating engaging employer content across different channels
A data driven mindset
A strong understanding of the recruitment world including how the startup / scale-up ecosystem in the Netherlands and Europe works
Experience with project and budget management
Excellent written and verbal English communication skills
Experience in corporate communications

Here's what we can offer you
A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You'll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.
Opportunities for personal and professional growth.

business support,Indeed,p_2132099a243e9335,Customer Support Specialist,Synthesis Retreat, Amsterdam,"Since 2018, The Synthesis Institute has been offering legal, medically-supervised and science-based psychedelic wellness retreats near Amsterdam for open-minded individuals who want to experience psychedelics for integrative healing and expansion potential.

Standing on years of experience and a reputation for offering world-class psychedelic retreats, Synthesis is uniquely qualified to set the standard for practitioners to safely, ethically and effectively support people on a journey for healing. As a result, in 2020, we opened registration for the Psychedelic Practitioner Training, a 12-month professional certification program that offers current leading-edge thinking and modalities associated with guiding clients through safe and ethical psychedelic journeys. The inaugural cohort began training in April 2021.

With the FDA designating psychedelic therapy a “breakthrough therapy,” and thereby helping to speed up the process of researching and approving it to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a new era is now upon us—one in which psychiatrists will be able to legally prescribe psychedelics in the United States.

Deeply rooted in a vision that everyone should have access to mental health and well-being, Synthesis is uniquely poised to usher in this new era, pioneering as a global leader in advancing research, convening community, educating the public and engaging in activism to promote safe and legal access to psychedelics.

The Synthesis Institute is based in Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with the Digital Education division based in Oregon in the United States. We are accepting candidates globally and will consider candidates willing and able to work remotely.

business support,Indeed,p_f4261c14a911741a,Customer Support Specialist,Synthesis Retreat, Amsterdam,"Since 2018, The Synthesis Institute has been offering legal, medically-supervised and science-based psychedelic wellness retreats near Amsterdam for open-minded individuals who want to experience psychedelics for integrative healing and expansion potential.

Standing on years of experience and a reputation for offering world-class psychedelic retreats, Synthesis is uniquely qualified to set the standard for practitioners to safely, ethically and effectively support people on a journey for healing. As a result, in 2020, we opened registration for the Psychedelic Practitioner Training, a 12-month professional certification program that offers current leading-edge thinking and modalities associated with guiding clients through safe and ethical psychedelic journeys. The inaugural cohort began training in April 2021.

With the FDA designating psychedelic therapy a “breakthrough therapy,” and thereby helping to speed up the process of researching and approving it to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), a new era is now upon us—one in which psychiatrists will be able to legally prescribe psychedelics in the United States.

Deeply rooted in a vision that everyone should have access to mental health and well-being, Synthesis is uniquely poised to usher in this new era, pioneering as a global leader in advancing research, convening community, educating the public and engaging in activism to promote safe and legal access to psychedelics.

The Synthesis Institute is based in Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with the Digital Education division based in Oregon in the United States. We are accepting candidates globally and will consider candidates willing and able to work remotely.

About the role
As an AI Technical Consultant, you will be the main communication point for clients when it comes down to the technical aspects of the project.

Following ING’s Think Forward Strategy to become the next generation digital bank, data and models are considered key assets in our bank. As model validators we safeguard the quality of ING’s models, which are used for all kinds of decision making purposes. We also contribute to the Model Risk Management (r)evolution that is picking up worldwide, given that models are imperfect representations of reality and hence may lead to financial losses and/or reputational damage. To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.

To effectively achieve these challenges, our Model Validation teams have been substantially growing in size lately and will further grow, also internationally.
We are responsible for validating IRRBB & ALM (“Asset & Liability Management”) models used by ING in about 40 countries all over the globe. We cover an interesting, wide and evolving model scope aimed to measure the impact of IRRBB on expected earnings and economic value as well as various ALM models used in balance sheet management. These models vary from those having a technically advanced quantitative orientation to those displaying strong expert judgment (in case of e.g. limited data availability). Our core business consists of independently assessing whether a particular model is fit for the purpose it was designed for, based on the business context, academic theories, empirical evidence, regulations, best practices & technological innovations. Effective challenge is key in our role. Herewith we contribute to sound business practices, supporting a healthy, sustainable ING and global financial stability.

You share your knowledge and effectively communicate with team members and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders. You also have the opportunity to participate in the development of innovative, state-of the-art validation frameworks and coding libraries.
Your main daily activities consist of the following:
Assessing the fundamental assumptions underlying the models in scope, whether the models are correctly implemented in the systems, and their appropriateness given the business and (evolving) regulatory context.
Writing high quality validation reports, to be discussed with e.g. model developers, senior management, auditors, the ECB and other regulators. These reports include a description of the methodology, your model risk assessment of the various model validation dimensions, as well as a number of findings for model improvement (which require follow-up by the developers).
Preparing ad-hoc analyses for e.g. senior management and providing advice on model risk.
Participating in the expansion and promotion of our new validation frameworks. These include policies, validation minimum standards and working instructions that aim to professionalize the model risk assessment based on the key model validation dimensions.
Participating in the development of our new validation coding libraries.

Your prospective model scope is broad and are related to the following main areas:
Behavioral: Modelling of mortgage & other loan prepayments and non-maturity deposits, as well as other embedded options in retail and wholesale products.

Pricing: Models used for product pricing.
Replication: Models used for risk transfer.
Risk measurement: Models used for risk management and reporting (NPVaR, RRaR, NIIaR).
As part of the IRRBB chapter, you will contribute to further building and developing the team by sharing knowledge, coaching more junior staff and by embracing ING’s Agile way of working.

agriculture,Indeed,p_b19d78247084afff,Full Stack Developer,Farm21, Amsterdam,"Working to help solve the global food crisis.
Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.
At Farm21 we operate in a small team, enabling us to develop new ideas quickly and innovate where we can. Our platform is the core of our company, making developers indispensable. Development of new features improves continuously due to our Agile way of working. Our developers are directly in contact with users and research partners, working together to achieve the main goal of feeding the world in 2050.
We’re reinventing our industry. We recently launched our solution which is spreading like wildfire. Sales has doubled our expectations. The farming industry is yearning for our products.
‍
This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

Software innovates agriculture. In every step in the food production chain data is driving daily decisions. Farm21 focuses on optimizing farming processes pre-sowing until post-harvest. We use machine learning and algorithms to analyze data from our own sensors, integrated third party data and user feedback. Our Farm21 assistant provides farmers with advice on actions needed for optimal crop growing conditions. This results in less waste of valuable resources, optimal land use and better livelihood for farmers. That is the power of our IT.
We use our solution to optimize all farms across the world, including smallholder farmers. They are responsible for 80% of the food consumed in developing countries. We believe that they too need to be part of the digitalization of agriculture in order to solve the world food crisis. We help to increase their yields, providing them with a better income and the world with more food.

‍
This is how it works.
As one of the first developers for Farm21 you are comfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself. Since our team is small you help to build the foundation of Farm21’s DevOps. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. What you develop should always be meaningful. Therefore, you help to translate user needs into platform improvements.
As Farm21 is a spin-off of software company 7Lab, we are supported by their team of skilled developers. They know all ins and outs of our platform and current development process, since they developed the greater part of our platform so far.
Reasons you want to join Farm21.
You want to work at Farm21 because we are a small team that is open to new ideas and iterates quickly. Fast progress and room for mistakes, which we then solve together. Also, you are never mindlessly doing one single task for days on end. Variety is key.
At Farm21 we always have the customer's needs in mind. This keeps us focussed and on track. If you want to spend weeks on developing features that never make it live, you don’t want to work at Farm21.
We are social in the way we work together. We have our weeklies and our daily huddles, but we’re always there to discuss with and help each other.
We are social in the way we do business. Aiming to optimize one of the most valuable industries in the world, with the goal of contributing to solving the world food crisis ahead.
We have fun Friday afternoon drinks, a modern office, young & enthusiastic team and quite often fun company trips.
We value non-working hours. We rarely exceed the 40 hours workweek and on the off chance that we do, we make sure to treat ourselves with pizza & drinks or a decent breakfast. Also, we offer five weeks of paid leave (based on 40 hours workweek). Go and see the world, or go on staycation. Just don’t work when you're off, we won’t allow you.
We’re open to discuss working hours, or “working from home” days.
Practicalities.
We’re located in Amsterdam. Our office is very accessible by public transport. If you don’t live close we can help you with your daily commute.
Being able to speak Dutch is not necessary.
A daily freshly prepared lunch is on us.
We have standing desks. But if you prefer you can also sit down (We mostly sit down anyway).
What we ask from you.
Bachelor degree or higher.
Experience with Laravel and/or JavaScript is key. Knowledge of the other techniques is a plus. Some techniques we use: Laravel, Laravel Horizon, JavaScript (Angular, Vue), Docker, Rest API's and Bootstrap.

We’re looking for an innovative educator who has experience with the international primary or middle years programme with strong collaboration skills, as you will be working closely with the Hermann Wesselink College (HWC) in Amstelveen setting up the International Crossover Class for children aged 11 and 12 which will start in March 2021.What is the International Crossover Class?The ICC offers high quality education for international students who want to start or continue studying an international curriculum. Children aged 11 or 12 who are new to the Netherlands and have not yet decided whether they want to enter Dutch, bilingual or international education, are welcome to join. In the Netherlands the first year of high school is for 12-year-olds. Children in this age group are not allowed to attend a Dutch primary school (group 8) or secondary school (grade 6) because they don’t speak the Dutch language or because they are too young. Therefore, new students who want to enter Dutch secondary education have to attend an intermediate year (language class) first to learn the Dutch language. If they prefer international education, the ICC could be a suitable place to start.The ICC offers an innovative curriculum. We will be following the International Middle Years Curriculum (IMYC). The language of instruction is English. A minimum of two Dutch lessons is also offered to our students as part of their integration in the Dutch culture. Our initiative supports all students who are in a transitional year between primary and secondary education.

teacher,Indeed,p_e1dbe9dcc93b07ec,Consultants Mozambique,Aflatoun, Amsterdam,"TERMS OF REFERENCE
Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Mozambique

From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam

When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February – April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.
Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background

Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information

While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).
Wona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment

In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

teacher,Indeed,p_56d5dddad7ed13a3,Consultants Zimbabwe,Aflatoun, Amsterdam,"TERMS OF REFERENCE
Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Zimbabwe
From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam
When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February – April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.

Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background
Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information
While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

In this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment
In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Côte d'Ivoire

From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam

When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February –April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.
Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background

Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information
While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

In this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Côte d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.
Inades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Côte d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Côte d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Côte d'Ivoire?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment

In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

Ironhack is an education startup that was founded to disrupt the way tech education works!

Doesn’t it seem odd that we’ve been learning the same way since the Industrial Revolution? Virtually all industries are pushing the limits on how to do things faster, better, and more efficiently. Yet, for the most part, people feel stuck on a 4+ year (and usually quite expensive) path that often results in an unfulfilling career path.

We empower students to create a new path - one that leads to meaningful careers in software development, product design or data analytics in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional education.

Our higher purpose is to transform the education space to be unapologetically outcomes-driven. Whether students are looking to change careers, get a promotion, skip University, or start their own company, we work tirelessly every day to make sure this path is as quick, immersive, and accessible as possible. Hearing these success stories is what gets us out of bed each day, excited to come to work :)

It’s with this mindset that we’ve become one of the key global players in bridging the digital skills gap, serving both those looking to get into tech, as well as the companies hungry for tech talent.

Every few weeks, a group of around 20 people of different nationalities and backgrounds - most of them not related to programming in any way - start their 11-week journey to becoming junior developers.

Some are looking to learn new skills and get a better job or a promotion, some are fresh out of school and decided they don’t want to follow a career in their field of study, but instead in software development, and others (the majority, actually) are looking to make a sometimes radical career change.

And they need you to guide them by:

Teaching, preparing, and improving classroom lectures for your students;
Evaluating students on homework assignments, mentoring them, and - if necessary - selecting them out of the program;
Developing software to support, automate, and improve the learning and teaching environments, using the same technologies you teach to your students.

We strongly believe that teachers should also be developers in their daily lives. That’s why this job includes both teaching and software development on our custom-built teaching and learning environment.

It’s also why prior experience in education, while obviously welcome, is not necessary, we can train you on the job.

And here’s what else we can offer you:

An inspiring environment where we prioritize adaptability, diversity, and lifelong learning;
Flexible schedules and work from home options;
Full coverage of travel expenses, no matter where you live in The Netherlands;
€1K annual budget for coaching and personal & professional development;
An increasingly diverse team of 20 passionate and skilled colleagues who are dedicated to filling the talent gap in tech;
 A workplace 5 minutes’ walking distance from Sloterdijk station in Amsterdam with sitting/standing desks, 4K monitors, and a new MacBook Pro;
Classrooms with modern equipment and tools;
Free lunch, tea, and coffee;
A competitive salary (€40-60K per year);
25 Vacation days per year;
Permanent contract plus stock options within 2 years;
Anything else we may agree to: feel free to discuss your needs and preferences.

Not for you, but you know someone who might be interested? Then please share ❤️

(unless you're a recruiter, then please know that we don't appreciate your unsolicited services).

As for what we expect from you:

Fluent in English (important one: all of our classes are taught in English);
Experience in full stack JavaScript development (NodeJS, ES7, and preferably some TypeScript or another typed language);
Experience with JavaScript frameworks (ideally React, Express, Koa, Mocha, Jest, and/or others);
Experience with Redux or similar;
Experience with data modelling for relational databases (we use Postgres specifically).

Because we're not only looking to fill the talent, but also the diversity gap in tech and we believe in practicing what we preach, we especially encourage candidates from under-represented groups in tech to apply.",-1,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=0cf1b8ddcb6e2e58&fccid=a0619323426653ae&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-01-26

The department is a unique combination of chemists, toxicologists and epidemiologists. Within the Department, the Environmental Health and Toxicology section has a keen focus on the developmental origin of health and disease. We aim to understand disease from a toxicological (mechanistic) perspective, as well as from an epidemiological viewpoint.

We strive to do this without the use of experimental animals.
