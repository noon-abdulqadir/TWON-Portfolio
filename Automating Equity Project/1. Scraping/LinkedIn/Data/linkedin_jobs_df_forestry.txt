1,forestry,Indeed,p_ade3b4e2fd8258cd,Policy Researcher,Profundo, Amsterdam,"You will participate in a variety of research projects for clients from across the globe, covering developments on various policy themes in various geographies. The research will relate to either public policies or private policies, or both. In the complex and evolving movement towards more sustainable practices and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the corporate and financial world, both types of policies play important and inter-linked roles.
In the field of private policies, we analyse and benchmark responsible credit and investment policies of financial institutions from all over the world, often using the Fair Finance Guide Methodology that we have developed together with the CSOs from 15 countries collaborating in Fair Finance International. This methodology is based on international standards and initiatives on almost all topics relevant for sustainability. We regularly refine and update the methodology, train researchers from Fair Finance Guide countries and review their assessments.
Other types of private policies we analyse are voluntary certification schemes and procurement policies (such as NDPE policies) in global commodity supply chains, like the forestry, agriculture, mining and fishery sectors. Creating transparency on the criteria included in these policies and assessing them against international standards is crucial to distinguish greenwashing schemes from genuine efforts to push for more sustainability in the corporate world.

The public policies of various governments which we analyse deal with market regulation, industrial policy and/or innovation in many different economic sectors, ranging from agriculture and other commodity sectors to the food, transport, construction, and financial sectors. Of special interest are public policies emerging in some countries which aim to integrate sustainability criteria (on climate change, biodiversity, or labour rights) in business operations overseas, in supply chains and in financing portfolios.
We expect you to:
have a university degree in a relevant field of study;
have five or more years of research experience in relation to private and/or public policies, preferably related to sustainability in the financial sector;
be a versatile and analytically strong researcher who can lead policy-related projects, collaborating with a diverse group of colleagues;
be knowledgeable on sustainability-related issues, preferably on climate change and natural resources;
have proven experience in writing and editing well-structured reports in English; experience in reading and writing in other major languages is an advantage; and
live within commuting distance of our office or have the willingness to relocate.

We offer:
the chance to work on challenging and varied research, advice and training projects with a high social relevance;
an organisational structure which aims to stimulate your personal and professional development;
collaboration within an international team of highly motivated colleagues with diverse fields of expertise;
daily contacts with an inspiring civil society network spanning the globe;
opportunities to further initiate and develop policy-related projects, working together with CSO partners to stimulate social change;
opportunities to travel abroad for trainings and meetings (COVID-regulations permitting);
a friendly office close to the Amsterdam Sloterdijk train station;
a contract for 32 to 40 hours per week (to be determined in consultation);
flexible working hours and the option to work part-time from home (but as long as COVID-regulations are in place we work mostly from home);
an initial monthly salary for 40 hours per week between € 3,491 and € 4,402, depending on years of experience; and
a good pension scheme and other fringe benefits.

JLT background

Our story starts in 1994. The Internet was new. Industrial computers were basic and 3G was still a dream. Over the following decades, JLT pioneered the rugged computing market. By taking design and quality to new levels, we brought the possibilities of computing to industries where a typical office machine might last just minutes. Today we are Sweden’s largest PC manufacturer, with over 100,000 computers shipped worldwide. But our mission remains the same as ever: we’re here to empower customers’ business by enabling hassle-free data communication in challenging environments.

We believe details make all the difference when it comes to rugged devices. That’s why we have our own engineering and manufacturing facilities in Sweden, enabling us to control every aspect of production with high precision. The result is that, without question, our customers can always count on quality. Additionally, JLT combines global resources with the agility of a small company. We take great pains to understand a customer’s operation and setup, and we go further than anyone to secure the performance they want. The performance of a rugged device is highly dependent on the ecosystem around it; everything from building layout to IT infrastructure plays a part. We understand all the complications and we’re focused on solving them for our customers. Drawing on years of experience and leading technical knowledge, we empower businesses and keep their operations running smoothly. Find out more at jltmobile.com
