environment The aim of the OU MinPlas project is to map out these individual processes for a number of important plastic sources integrally by means of modelling These include, for example, wear and tear of car tyres, plastic granules and textile fibres In collaboration with stakeholders, we will then look at how the relevant production, use and waste disposal processes for the selected plastic
