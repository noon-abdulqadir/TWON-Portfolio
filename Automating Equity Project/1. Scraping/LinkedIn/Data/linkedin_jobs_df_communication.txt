Storytel is one of the world’s leading audiobook and e-book streaming services and we offer unlimited listening to consumers in 20+ markets, with several new markets launching in the coming year. Our vision is to make the world a more empathetic place with great stories to be shared and enjoyed by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We are now looking for a Head of European Operations to join the team!

About the Role
To continue our successful growth and expansion journey within Europe, we are looking for a business leader to head our European Operations (excluding the Nordics), which today consists of 2 hubs comprising 9 markets and 8 local team operations – from our oldest operations in the Netherlands to our most recently launched market Israel.
As Head of European Operations, you will work with our Head of Hubs and Country Managers to ensure a continuous +50% market growth, calibrating resources across markets, building brand awareness and further improving our local product market fit by applying the right set of offerings, partnerships and growth strategies in each market. You will also plan continuous expansion together with the Head of Hubs and Expansion Leads into more European markets.
In this role, you will be overall responsible for the performance and growth of the European business as a whole. This entails translating company goals into tangible KPIs for the European markets, setting short and long-term strategies for growth as well as profitability, developing an efficient organization that balances global and local capabilities, running budget processes and following up on progress.
Storytel is a non-hierarchical organization with lots of cross-functional processes to ensure seamless collaboration between our Commercial operations with the Content, Product, Tech and administrative departments. You will be an important stakeholder to our Global commercial and Product teams when it comes to growth and subscriptions.

About the Team
As Head of European Operations, you report to Ingrid Bojner, CCO (Chief Commercial Officer). Together with the Head of Nordics and the Head of International operations as well as the strategic Commercial functions (Growth strategy, Acquisition, Brand and Engagement), you form the Commercial Leadership team. As part of this team, you will work in a dynamic setting, with continuous organizational development to ensure we deliver on our customer promise to make the world a better place by making stories available to anyone, anywhere, anytime, and to achieve high-set global targets of 35% revenue growth as well as explicit EBITDA targets.
Storytel’s culture encourages self-leadership, innovation, collaboration and our employees share a common passion for high-quality content and stories. There is a strong emphasis on continuous development, learning through experimentation and actively sharing feedback to constantly improve performance.
Therefore, we believe you are open-minded, pragmatic and have a passion for building and developing businesses. You understand the beauty of delegating mandate and can work without prestige with all functions in Storytel. You will be an important commercial stakeholder towards our Product and Tech teams and work very closely with the global Content team to ensure the best content available in our services.

About You
To be successful in this role we believe that you have

8+ years of proven work experience from areas within business management, operations, strategy or similar

Experience from successful high-growth online consumer business, media and entertainment, tech and or product services

International profile and experience – location is of less importance

Solid understanding of subscription business models

An entrepreneurial mindset, excellent leadership and communication skills

Ability to thrive when building efficient organizations with high level of autonomy and collaboration

Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken

To thrive in this role, we believe that you are data driven, have high execution capacity and great organizational skills. Your experience should include leading a significant and relevant business organization within an online consumer or subscription business (ideally content driven, although not required) set in an international context. Strong leadership skills evidenced by a track record of successfully bringing accomplished and culturally diverse teams across multiple geographies together will be key.

What we offer
Storytel offers a friendly, entrepreneurial and fast-moving work environment where new ideas and creativity are welcomed. We like doing things in new ways and questioning old methods.

We are now looking for a Head of European Operations to join the team!

About the Role
To continue our successful growth and expansion journey within Europe, we are looking for a business leader to head our European Operations (excluding the Nordics), which today consists of 2 hubs comprising 9 markets and 8 local team operations – from our oldest operations in the Netherlands to our most recently launched market Israel.
As Head of European Operations, you will work with our Head of Hubs and Country Managers to ensure a continuous +50% market growth, calibrating resources across markets, building brand awareness and further improving our local product market fit by applying the right set of offerings, partnerships and growth strategies in each market. You will also plan continuous expansion together with the Head of Hubs and Expansion Leads into more European markets.
In this role, you will be overall responsible for the performance and growth of the European business as a whole. This entails translating company goals into tangible KPIs for the European markets, setting short and long-term strategies for growth as well as profitability, developing an efficient organization that balances global and local capabilities, running budget processes and following up on progress.

You will be an important stakeholder to our Global commercial and Product teams when it comes to growth and subscriptions.

About the Team
As Head of European Operations, you report to Ingrid Bojner, CCO (Chief Commercial Officer). Together with the Head of Nordics and the Head of International operations as well as the strategic Commercial functions (Growth strategy, Acquisition, Brand and Engagement), you form the Commercial Leadership team. As part of this team, you will work in a dynamic setting, with continuous organizational development to ensure we deliver on our customer promise to make the world a better place by making stories available to anyone, anywhere, anytime, and to achieve high-set global targets of 35% revenue growth as well as explicit EBITDA targets.

Storytel is one of the world’s leading audiobook and e-book streaming services and we offer unlimited listening to consumers in 20+ markets, with several new markets launching in the coming year. Our vision is to make the world a more empathetic place with great stories to be shared and enjoyed by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We are now looking for a Head of European Operations to join the team!

About the Role
To continue our successful growth and expansion journey within Europe, we are looking for a business leader to head our European Operations (excluding the Nordics), which today consists of 2 hubs comprising 9 markets and 8 local team operations – from our oldest operations in the Netherlands to our most recently launched market Israel.
As Head of European Operations, you will work with our Head of Hubs and Country Managers to ensure a continuous +50% market growth, calibrating resources across markets, building brand awareness and further improving our local product market fit by applying the right set of offerings, partnerships and growth strategies in each market. You will also plan continuous expansion together with the Head of Hubs and Expansion Leads into more European markets.
In this role, you will be overall responsible for the performance and growth of the European business as a whole. This entails translating company goals into tangible KPIs for the European markets, setting short and long-term strategies for growth as well as profitability, developing an efficient organization that balances global and local capabilities, running budget processes and following up on progress.
Storytel is a non-hierarchical organization with lots of cross-functional processes to ensure seamless collaboration between our Commercial operations with the Content, Product, Tech and administrative departments. You will be an important stakeholder to our Global commercial and Product teams when it comes to growth and subscriptions.

About the Team
As Head of European Operations, you report to Ingrid Bojner, CCO (Chief Commercial Officer). Together with the Head of Nordics and the Head of International operations as well as the strategic Commercial functions (Growth strategy, Acquisition, Brand and Engagement), you form the Commercial Leadership team. As part of this team, you will work in a dynamic setting, with continuous organizational development to ensure we deliver on our customer promise to make the world a better place by making stories available to anyone, anywhere, anytime, and to achieve high-set global targets of 35% revenue growth as well as explicit EBITDA targets.
Storytel’s culture encourages self-leadership, innovation, collaboration and our employees share a common passion for high-quality content and stories. There is a strong emphasis on continuous development, learning through experimentation and actively sharing feedback to constantly improve performance.
Therefore, we believe you are open-minded, pragmatic and have a passion for building and developing businesses. You understand the beauty of delegating mandate and can work without prestige with all functions in Storytel. You will be an important commercial stakeholder towards our Product and Tech teams and work very closely with the global Content team to ensure the best content available in our services.

About You
To be successful in this role we believe that you have

8+ years of proven work experience from areas within business management, operations, strategy or similar

Experience from successful high-growth online consumer business, media and entertainment, tech and or product services

International profile and experience – location is of less importance

Solid understanding of subscription business models

An entrepreneurial mindset, excellent leadership and communication skills

Ability to thrive when building efficient organizations with high level of autonomy and collaboration

Excellent English communication skills, both written and spoken

To thrive in this role, we believe that you are data driven, have high execution capacity and great organizational skills. Your experience should include leading a significant and relevant business organization within an online consumer or subscription business (ideally content driven, although not required) set in an international context. Strong leadership skills evidenced by a track record of successfully bringing accomplished and culturally diverse teams across multiple geographies together will be key.

What we offer
Storytel offers a friendly, entrepreneurial and fast-moving work environment where new ideas and creativity are welcomed. We like doing things in new ways and questioning old methods. The Storytel culture – characterized by being welcoming and helpful – is important to us. We don’t believe in hierarchy and micromanagement; we highly believe in giving responsibility and having people grow alongside it. And of course – you get unlimited listening to audio and e-books from our service!

About us


Cristóbal Balenciaga founded the House in 1917 in his home of Spain. In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house.

Among the archetypal products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.

BALENCIAGA Sales Advisor Amsterdam De Bijenkorf


About us


Cristóbal Balenciaga founded the House in 1917 in his home of Spain. In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house.


While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.


Since October 2015, Demna Gvasalia has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.


The Balenciaga House, part of the Kering group since 2001, is one of the most influential names in fashion.

BALENCIAGA Sales Advisor Amsterdam De Bijenkorf


About us


Cristóbal Balenciaga founded the House in 1917 in his home of Spain. In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as “The Couturier of the Couturiers” by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house.


While the brand’s identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful.


Since October 2015, Demna Gvasalia has designed both men’s and women’s collections as the artistic director.


The Balenciaga House, part of the Kering group since 2001, is one of the most influential names in fashion.

62,communication,Indeed,p_3a42bc7bf42d1fc8,Technical Support Engineer,Teamleader, Amsterdam,"To keep fuelling our growth, we are looking for a Technical Support Engineer for our Yadera Product
Who we are and why should you care?
You'll be specifically working on our Yadera product. Yadera, acquired by Teamleader in 2019, is run by a small <10 group of people with big ambitions; a start-up within a scale-up. While Teamleader, founded in 2012 in Ghent, focuses on small businesses by offering an all-in-one solution for CRM, project management and invoicing, Yadera focuses specifically on medium to large agencies. By joining forces, we became the best choice for any professional service business, big or small, that aims to automate and simplify work.
Over the years, we’ve won numerous awards that prove our dedication towards our cause. We’ve gained a foothold in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Yet our ambition stretches far and beyond, as we want to become Europe’s #1 in our industry. Today, our team consists of 180+ people and is still growing strong.
What an average work week looks like:

If you join our Yadera team, it’s because you strive to be a product expert on the one hand and derive your energy from delighting customers on the other.

Developing product expertise is key in this role. That expertise comes in handy when helping out our customers at the front line. By talking to customers on a daily basis, you get a deep understanding of both our product and our customers. You’ll represent the voice of the customer by actively passing on their feedback and requests to the product & development department. It’s a team effort: our support engineers pick each other’s brain constantly to assure accurate, timely and surprising support that our customers ask for and deserve.

As a support engineer for our Yadera product you

are the point of contact in the post-sales process.
are in contact with customers on a daily basis (mostly virtually, occasionally F2F).
solve technical problems but are not afraid to talk business either.
will be in contact with the development for feedback and requests.

You will talk with tons of entrepreneurs, project managers, CFO, operational managers, everyday. You’ll see them grow and help them become more successful. In turn, you’ll gain new product insights daily, which makes you the expert for our customers and your colleagues.
Why others chose Teamleader: we're lively, not corporate

You are part of a fast-growing company that values getting things done and honest communication. The result: a fast-paced tech environment, open feedback culture, room for initiatives and ideas.
We have the energy and boldness of a start-up and the expertise and pragmatism of a scale-up. The result: a team of both young and seasoned professionals led by supportive and approachable managers who give recognition and rewards for hard work. We also value transparency about results and strategy.
You have your own personal budget to spend on training or (virtual) events and numerous other internal advantages. The result: continuous growth and learning.
You have a pleasant and comfortable workplace within cycling and walking distance of the heart of Amsterdam or Ghent. But we are flexible: working remotely is absolutely no problem. And mandatory since the world got hit by COVID-19.


Even in COVID times, Teamleader is a happy, purposeful place. While we miss our shared kitchen and sunlit terrace, our setup allowed for a swift change to a functional and engaging remote work environment. We compensate for social distance with quizzes, cocktails delivered at home, informal chats and events, work-time flexibility, competitions, extra coaching and everything else you can think of.

Requirements
You ...

Are driven by helping customers get the most out of Yadera. In fact, customer satisfaction means the world to you.
Are patient, emphatic and you are able to keep your calm, even when things get busy.
Have awesome problem-solving skills and a razor-sharp, analytical mind.
Have the ability to quickly build up excellent product knowledge and do what it takes to keep this up-to-date

We have the energy and boldness of a start-up and the expertise and pragmatism of a scale-up. The result: a team of both young and seasoned professionals led by supportive and approachable managers who give recognition and rewards for hard work. We also value transparency about results and strategy.
You have your own personal budget to spend on training or (virtual) events and numerous other internal advantages. The result: continuous growth and learning.
You have a pleasant and comfortable workplace within cycling and walking distance of the heart of Amsterdam or Ghent. But we are flexible: working remotely is absolutely no problem. And mandatory since the world got hit by COVID-19.


Even in COVID times, Teamleader is a happy, purposeful place. While we miss our shared kitchen and sunlit terrace, our setup allowed for a swift change to a functional and engaging remote work environment. We compensate for social distance with quizzes, cocktails delivered at home, informal chats and events, work-time flexibility, competitions, extra coaching and everything else you can think of.

Who we are and why should you care?
You'll be specifically working on our Yadera product. Yadera, acquired by Teamleader in 2019, is run by a small <10 group of people with big ambitions; a start-up within a scale-up. While Teamleader, founded in 2012 in Ghent, focuses on small businesses by offering an all-in-one solution for CRM, project management and invoicing, Yadera focuses specifically on medium to large agencies. By joining forces, we became the best choice for any professional service business, big or small, that aims to automate and simplify work.
Over the years, we’ve won numerous awards that prove our dedication towards our cause. We’ve gained a foothold in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Yet our ambition stretches far and beyond, as we want to become Europe’s #1 in our industry. Today, our team consists of 180+ people and is still growing strong.
What an average work week looks like:

If you join our Yadera team, it’s because you strive to be a product expert on the one hand and derive your energy from delighting customers on the other.

Developing product expertise is key in this role. That expertise comes in handy when helping out our customers at the front line. By talking to customers on a daily basis, you get a deep understanding of both our product and our customers. You’ll represent the voice of the customer by actively passing on their feedback and requests to the product & development department. It’s a team effort: our support engineers pick each other’s brain constantly to assure accurate, timely and surprising support that our customers ask for and deserve.

As a support engineer for our Yadera product you

are the point of contact in the post-sales process.
are in contact with customers on a daily basis (mostly virtually, occasionally F2F).
solve technical problems but are not afraid to talk business either.
will be in contact with the development for feedback and requests.

You will talk with tons of entrepreneurs, project managers, CFO, operational managers, everyday. You’ll see them grow and help them become more successful. In turn, you’ll gain new product insights daily, which makes you the expert for our customers and your colleagues.

By talking to customers on a daily basis, you get a deep understanding of both our product and our customers. You’ll represent the voice of the customer by actively passing on their feedback and requests to the product & development department. It’s a team effort: our support engineers pick each other’s brain constantly to assure accurate, timely and surprising support that our customers ask for and deserve.

As a support engineer for our Yadera product you

will be in contact with the development for feedback and requests.

You will talk with tons of entrepreneurs, project managers, CFO, operational managers, everyday. You’ll see them grow and help them become more successful. In turn, you’ll gain new product insights daily, which makes you the expert for our customers and your colleagues.
Why others chose Teamleader: we're lively, not corporate

You are part of a fast-growing company that values getting things done and honest communication. The result: a fast-paced tech environment, open feedback culture, room for initiatives and ideas.
We have the energy and boldness of a start-up and the expertise and pragmatism of a scale-up. The result: a team of both young and seasoned professionals led by supportive and approachable managers who give recognition and rewards for hard work. We also value transparency about results and strategy.
You have your own personal budget to spend on training or (virtual) events and numerous other internal advantages. The result: continuous growth and learning.
You have a pleasant and comfortable workplace within cycling and walking distance of the heart of Amsterdam or Ghent. But we are flexible: working remotely is absolutely no problem. And mandatory since the world got hit by COVID-19.


Even in COVID times, Teamleader is a happy, purposeful place. While we miss our shared kitchen and sunlit terrace, our setup allowed for a swift change to a functional and engaging remote work environment. We compensate for social distance with quizzes, cocktails delivered at home, informal chats and events, work-time flexibility, competitions, extra coaching and everything else you can think of.

About the role
Kantar have been awarded a contract by Nationaal Media Onderzoek (NMO) to provide audience measurement solution for TV viewing, online video and browsing to the Dutch Media industry. NMO aims to deliver deeper insights to understand Dutch audiences and enable richer trading currencies. This will be delivered using a national panel of households, in which Kantar meter technology is installed on TV sets and broadband networks.
The “set up” phase of the new service accelerates in 2021, and a full service will be live in 2022.
Following our recent new business success, we have several vacancies for a Panel Administrator/ Telephony Operator.
The Panel Administrator works within the Panel Operations team, performing a variety of tasks relating to the running of a TV audience measurement panel. On a day to day basis, panel administrators will be calling panel members to discuss issues, to arrange service calls for field technicians, and to perform quality control checks. The administrator will also be working extensively with field technicians (by phone) to verify the quality of the work done in panel homes. As a result of these activities, the administrator will be updating the panel databases (coding work). This coding work is vital to the success of the service and must be performed to an extremely high level of accuracy.
Role Description
Panel Administrators are part of a team in which responsibilities are shared, under the supervision of the Panel Manager:
Maintenance of the “panel masterfiles”, which contain all of the required information about panel homes’ demographic characteristics. This is coding work.
Provision of panel member & technician support during the week and at weekends, and to monitor a free phone line daily, including Public Holidays.
Liaison with panel households to ensure the highest quality co-operation from members of the panel.
Performing telephone checks with panel members in response to queries generated by the data fault management system.
Responsible for replacements of Panellists when there are dropouts
Dealing with and resolving panel member queries (usually via telephone).
Assisting with monitoring & management of the incentive scheme.
