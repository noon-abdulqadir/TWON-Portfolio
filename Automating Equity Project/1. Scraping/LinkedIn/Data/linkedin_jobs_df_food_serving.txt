18,food serving,Indeed,p_12ed3a6804310c20,hospitality night ambassador Amsterdam,citizenM, Amsterdam,"hello fellow mobile citizens,

What a year 2020 has been! Now, in 2021 - and with the vaccine around the corner - we are excited to begin looking ahead and truly hope the world will open up soon. Unfortunately, we do not have a crystal ball to tell us exactly when this will happen but one thing we do know for sure: we want to be ready. This is where YOU come in…

In preparation for the excitement 2021 is sure to bring, we are opening our night ambassador job posting now so that we can get in touch and stay in touch with YOU! While the exact start date of this position is still a bit uncertain, we want to start the conversation now so that we can connect you with the opportunities we have available as soon as the time is right. (OR: 2020 has taught us all a lot about uncertainty. We don’t want uncertainty to get in the way of connecting you with opportunities we have available which is why we’d like to start the conversation now.)

citizenM is a hotel providing affordable luxury for the mobile citizens of the world. With style that'll knock your socks off, we offer citizens a real home from home, plus the world’s fluffiest pillows. Our typical guest is a frequent traveler who is quality and design driven, and cost conscious.

We currently have hotels in Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen, New York and Paris, with more to come in Europe, the US and Asia. We are proud to have put the hospitality back into the hospitality industry, and have received numerous awards for our groundbreaking approach.

Why working for us is different
We won’t put you in a box as a ‘receptionist’ or ‘food and beverage’ person. With us, you’ll become a champion multitasker – customer service, receptionist, concierge, barista, mixologist, logistics and more. You will be a citizenM ambassador, free to be yourself to do the best job you can. We believe in making work fun. If you’re having a great experience, so will our guests. We promise we’ll never ask you to wear a silly bellboy hat.

We’re proud to put hospitality back in the hospitality industry, and that’s because of our ambassadors. We don’t hire them for their skills; we hire them for their attitude. We seek people who feel great about making people smile. You see the results in the rave reviews we receive online.

Your typical citizenM shift could include:

Making sure everyone gets a warm welcome as soon as they walk in
Helping guests at the self check-in kiosks (we have no reception desk)
Serving hot and cold local food (yes, even open sandwiches and herring)
Brewing delicious coffee or mixing a signature cocktail
Being a secret concierge to the city, answering guests’ questions about the best places to visit, eat, shop or party
Maintaining the living room, canteen, and arranging food displays for the following day

Typical shifts are: 23.00 - 07.00

Do you have what we’re looking for?
As we said before, you don’t need to come with experience in the hospitality industry, but you do need to come with the right attitude.

To be a successful at citizenM, you’ll need to have:

A genuine touch: Treat all people as you would treat your best friends.
A passionate attitude: Be optimistic and positive. You like to surprise and make people smile.
A contemporary style: You’re inspired by design and creativity, and love to use technology to simplify your life.
And you’ll need to be:

A smart thinker: You thrive on turning traditional thinking on its head and want to do things right the first time.
Really caring: You want to do the right thing for our guests, your colleagues, community and for the planet.
Fluent in English: It’s the way of the world. Other language abilities are welcome too!

What’s in it for you?
You’ll be joining a team of ambassadors who are proud to put on their citizenM outfit every day and go out to wow our guests. You’ll help us shake up the traditional hotel industry by providing the thing our guests love most about us: exceptional service.

You’ll take responsibility for your own success and you’ll be rewarded for your individual contribution. We’ll help you develop with a specialised training program and help you grow with a personal development plan (with potential for international travel, management opportunities, and work at the support office in the Netherlands).

Whether you’re interested in building a career in hospitality, or want to strike a balance between work and your other interests, we are the right place if you have a genuine passion for helping people, whatever your background.

citizenM loves diversity. We are an equal opportunity employer and welcome applications from anyone.

If you want to help redefine the world of hospitality for today’s mobile citizens, then we’d love to see you at one of our casting days. Apply now!

Why should you join Domestic Appliances?
Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Perfect Care Steam Generators, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world.
In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
In its 128-year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.

Our mission is to be the definitive food company. We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.

Our journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.

Fast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.

Delivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.

We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

There are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

The size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.

We hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.


Responsibilities & Requirements

The successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands. This would involve both public affairs and corporate communications. You will therefore need to have both the judgement to decide on priorities and the dynamic hunger to deliver against them.

You would report to Deliveroo's global policy and communications team in London. You would also work closely with Deliveroo's General Manager in the Netherlands, as well as other senior figures in both Amsterdam and London.

As part of your job, you would ensure:

that Deliveroo is generating a stream of proactive and creative media opportunities in the Netherlands;
That the business responds to risks and opportunities arising from public affairs and regulatory issues in market;
the company is proactive in dealing with challenges, in communicating our business model and policy positions, and in demonstrating our commitment to the communities in which we operate;

Important competencies for the successful candidate will include:

Several years experience in fields relating to Dutch media and politics - a combination of both would be highly valued;
Strong pre-existing relationships and network that could be used for both corporate communications and public affairs;
An understanding of the policy and regulatory issues facing companies in the gig economy.

A proactive attitude and a desire to learn about and help make decisions right across the business, including commercial and operational decisions.

A desire to work in a close-knit team and across multiple teams in a growing organisation, in particular policy, legal, finance and operations.

An excellent verbal and written communicator with the ability to prioritise.
Fluency in both Dutch and English.


Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.


Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around",-1,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=47c15cb0d8ab99be&fccid=1d79a4290fb70d8e&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-04-21,en,No,No,water supply and waste management,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,,E,0.19444444444444445,0.8055555555555556,0.5833333333333334,0.4444444444444444,Male,Older

Fast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.

Delivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.

We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

There are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

The size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.

We hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.

Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.


Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

98,food serving,Indeed,p_5d455c047805a4aa,"Head of Corporate Affairs, Netherlands",Deliveroo, Amsterdam,"Why Deliveroo?

Our mission is to be the definitive food company. We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.

Our journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.

Fast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.

Delivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.

We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

There are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.

The size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.

We hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.


Responsibilities & Requirements

The successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands. This would involve both public affairs and corporate communications. You will therefore need to have both the judgement to decide on priorities and the dynamic hunger to deliver against them.

You would report to Deliveroo's global policy and communications team in London. You would also work closely with Deliveroo's General Manager in the Netherlands, as well as other senior figures in both Amsterdam and London.

As part of your job, you would ensure:

that Deliveroo is generating a stream of proactive and creative media opportunities in the Netherlands;
That the business responds to risks and opportunities arising from public affairs and regulatory issues in market;
the company is proactive in dealing with challenges, in communicating our business model and policy positions, and in demonstrating our commitment to the communities in which we operate;

Important competencies for the successful candidate will include:

Several years experience in fields relating to Dutch media and politics - a combination of both would be highly valued;
Strong pre-existing relationships and network that could be used for both corporate communications and public affairs;
An understanding of the policy and regulatory issues facing companies in the gig economy.

A proactive attitude and a desire to learn about and help make decisions right across the business, including commercial and operational decisions.

A desire to work in a close-knit team and across multiple teams in a growing organisation, in particular policy, legal, finance and operations.

An excellent verbal and written communicator with the ability to prioritise.
Fluency in both Dutch and English.


Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.


Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around",-1,-1,https://indeed.nljavascript:void(0);,https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=5d455c047805a4aa&fccid=a7f7ef4951d63c7c&vjs=3,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,Meer dan 30 dagen geleden,2021-04-21,en,No,No,accommodation and food serving,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,,I,0.5025252525252525,0.494949494949495,0.1893939393939394,0.8080808080808081,Mixed Gender,Younger
