wildlife We take a which values  we look at real issues faced by local people and try to develop practical, sustainable alternatives We envision a sustainable Amazon where education and learning is the forefront for driving understanding and change The Amazon is under constant threat from many processes that cause habitat destruction such as logging, agriculture and mining Our sustainable initiative projects provide alternative forms of income that can help protect the rainforest as well as give people a livelihood This means that we help protect one of the most biodiverse places in the world, preventing the extinction of species, and other associated effects of rainforest destruction, such as climate changeAll our projects focus on two main areas which focuses directly on the rainforest, and where we work with local Communities The Manu Biosphere is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, with millions of species awaiting study, and numerous local communities living nearbyIn Manu we have a great opportunity to study conservation and biodiversity issues on micro and macro scales from endemic species of frogs that are not found anywhere else to a larger ecosystem approach By studying animal distribution and ecology on our reserve, looking at where they can be found, at what times and what weather conditions, we can begin to understand the relationship between the forest and the wildlife The people that live in Manu face issues of poverty, low education standards, malnutrition and lack of resources In trying to provide for their families, people can sometimes end up in dangerous, unsustainable jobs like slash and burn agriculture and illegal logging Our community projects were set up to investigate and provide alternative, safe, sustainable ways to earn their money and feed their familiesResearchThe Amazon is a delicately balanced ecosystem, however, human destruction of the rainforest is happening at such an alarming rate that these pristine environments are being systematically destroyedSo what happens when a patch of destroyed rainforest is left alone, when the jungle is allowed to reclaim it and life slowly returns Our project is uniquely placed to investigate this, as for many years now our reserve has been naturally regenerating from when it was once farmlandOur biodiversity monitoring plan is investigating the value of regenerating tropical rainforest for biodiversity and how species move back to forest that has a history of human disturbance This is the challenge we have set ourselves to answer through the Research Monitoring Programme, which is run in partnership with leading universities such as the University of Glasgow and Oxford University By developing longterm comparative studies we can understand how forests regenerate that have experienced different types and levels of disturbance We examine how the diversity of life can return if we promote and nurture successful rainforest regeneration As agricultural and industrial activities move into new areas to exploit, the biological value of regenerating forests is becoming increasingly important and our studies aim to investigate thisOur scientific research programme has 3 main areas of focusAs an intern, you will work alongside our field staff with the investigations that will answer these questionsMascotania Macaw monitoring programmeThe blueheaded macaw is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, meaning it is threatened with extinction The blueheaded macaw lives in a very specific habitat and so is heavily affected by deforestation and other human disturbances Their numbers are further damaged by exploitation for the pet trade, a growing problem in PeruSo far we have found a decrease in the number of blueheaded macaws on the reserve over the past few years, correlating with an increase in tourist numbers Our aim is to successfully understand their behaviour and to educate tourists about responsible bird watching You will be involved in this by helping to monitor the number of blueheaded macaws visiting our clay lick at dawn as well as noting their activity, and recording the impacts of tourism on the birdsAvian monitoring in different stages of forest regenerationBird species composition and diversity can signify many different things about the forest, such as forest type, structure, age, health, and level and type of human impact Hunting pressure and habitat fragmentation through roads and deforestation can largely affect bird populations For example, healthy populations of game birds such as guans, tinamous and trumpeters indicate low to zero hunting pressure, whilst the presence of a highly specialist species such as the harpy eagle may indicate undisturbed primary forest Not only is the ecology of many of these tropical foothill species poorly known, but the true value of regenerating forest for birds is understudied We conduct early morning transects along the reserve to listen and look for birdsButterfly monitoring in different stages of forest regenerationThere are currently more than 550 known species of butterfly at the reserve Butterflies are significant bioindicators as well as pollinators for many plant species, which makes understanding their distribution throughout the forest, species density and fluctuations over time, a significant research project for us Butterfly larvae have highly specialised diets, so we can learn about the vegetation in each part of the forest by looking at the species we find in them, and by comparing our findings in each forest type we can see what effect regenerating forest has on species distributionYou will be involved in setting up butterfly traps and bait, identifying them and recording new species to the reserve Butterflies teach us a lot about the forest and the changes that take place within it We are working on producing a comprehensive guide for visitors to the reserveAmphibian and reptile monitoring in different stages of forest regenerationAmphibians are excellent indicator species as they are extremely vulnerable to changes in their environment They have very thin skin which they use for gas exchange, and this makes them very sensitive to chemical pollutants and also to changes in climate eg temperature and humidity This means that they are one of the most important bioindicator species on the reserve, but it also means they are incredibly vulnerable, and are threatened by human activity the world over Studying the way they use regenerating forest is therefore vital for assessing its conservation valueMammal monitoring in different stages of forest regenerationIn order to understand the importance of regenerating rainforest for mammal species, we have used a series of camera traps set up around the reserve to capture images of mammals in all three forest types So far more than 40 large mammal species have been recorded at the MLC, including 13 individual jaguar Due to the elusive nature of many mammal species the rest of our research is more adhoc You may find yourself unexpectedly tracking puma prints for half an hour, or trying to frantically count the number of peccaries that just crossed your path These encounters are vital to our understanding of the way mammals use regenerating forestSustainable Community InitiativesWe work with local communities in Manu to create sustainable income that meets the challenges faced by remote rainforest towns Poverty and lack of access to higher education in Manu forces many families into unsustainable work such as illegal logging, slash and burn agriculture, and mining Not only are these often dangerous and unhealthy, with little financial return, they also contribute to rainforest destruction To date our community projects have positively impacted more than 600 peopleBiogardensWe work specifically with local mothers to combat malnutrition, by providing resources and knowledge to build biogardens that produce nutritious, fresh food for families, and extra income through surplus crops So far volunteers and local mothers have created over 60 family biogardens, and have helped build two institutional biogardens Since beginning our work with biogardens in 2009, this has resulted in an annual increase in income for the direct beneficiaries of biogardens, and an increase in child nutrition and healthAgroforestryThe agroforestry plots are planted with local farmers, and provide both short and longterm income through producing sustainable wood with banana production This is an environmentally sustainable livelihood that provides a sustainable alternative to illegal logging activities in the surrounding forest Agroforestry encourages species diversity, increases soil nutrition, and creates carbon credits that can be sold to further support the projectWe have helped turn more than 61 hectares of abandoned and degraded land into agroforestry plots, which have subsequently seen increased biodiversity, help plant over 10,000 banana trees, 7,000 hardwood and softwood trees, and created the first program in Peru to ever commercialise carbon credits on behalf of a local community sold to Oriel College Oxford Universityall information above is subject to change Please check the most up to date information on the Global Nomadic website when

exposed to disasters due to the hydrometeorological phenomena and natural hazards While drought and floods are among top hydrometeorological hazards caused by extreme weather and climate events, due to the current and projected abnormal high temperatures leading to water scarcity the incidence of forest fires is increasingly posing a threat to the natural ecosystems, agricultural system and human settlements With the projected decrease in surface water availability by 1620 by 2020 due to climate change, the water supply for all users requires adaptation options to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities related to water stress In Moldovas climate induced disasters are occurring more frequently and on a recurring basis, causing an average of 4 million US dollars per year of economic damageClimate scenarios also indicate the country is trending strongly towards becoming more arid This will intensify not only droughts but also fires Unfortunately, rural communities experience a capacity deficit in terms of fire prevention, preparedness and timely response mainly due to liquidation of over 400 equipped and capacitated firefighting units following the extensive privatization process from the 90s Subsequently, the intervention radius of 3 km according to norms increased to up to 1015 km in urban areas and 4050 km in rural areas where 70 of the total number of fires occur It resulted in increased response time and lower awareness of fire risks by the rural population, subsequently leading to considerable increase in loss of life, material damages and affected ecosystems It is widely accepted that rural women are disproportionately affected by fires due to them being mostly engaged in cooking in unsafe cookstoves and collection of firewood in ecosystems that might be at high risk of fires Overall, during 2008 and 2017, in Moldova were registered about 8 725 fires resulting in 1 356 deaths, including 61 children In the rural areas, poor and lowincome households are mostly exposed to fire risks due to also lack of proper fire prevention measures and adapted techniques, education and awarenessAgainst this background, the project aims to increase resilience and adaptive capacities of rural communities to climate change and disasters through improved water storage infrastructures and disasters risk reduction measures The project is supporting

Brabant, Netherlands","Industry":"['Electrical\/', 'Electronic Manufacturing']","Job Description":"GeneralThe design of dynamical systems is a cornerstone discipline within Mechanical Engineering and industry needs engineers with excellent design skills, combining both analytical and creative skill sets Moreover, society and industry pose increasingly stringent requirements on the functionality, performance, safety and agility of both products and processes Examples are manufacturing processes, automotive systems, energy conversion, storage and exploration applications, health applications, such as medical imaging systems, manufacturing plants and distribution centers, hightech systems, robots for manufacturing, care and cure, and many more Such increasing expectations for engineering systems lead to a matching increase in the complexity of the related design process, which can only be tamed by an inherently multidisciplinary modelbased design processResearch fieldShaping the design process for the engineering systems of the future poses many challenges related to system complexity Namely, the complexity of such engineering systems is induced by 1 the required level of multifunctionality and safety, 2 their interconnectivity, to other engineering systems and humans, and 3 the requirements on agility responsiveness, autonomy Research to support such complex engineering design demands a crossdisciplinary attitude of researchers and a multidisciplinary research approach, relying on expertise not only from disciplines within Mechanical Engineering dynamics, material science, thermo and fluiddynamics, acoustics, etc, but also from Physics, Electrical and Chemical Engineering In fact, when envisioning a modelbased design approach, which has proven merit to stateofpractice hightech systems design, we need models thatThis research theme provides ample opportunity for fundamental, interdisciplinary research and valorization in a wide range of applications, many of which are strongly rooted in the Dutch hightech  manufacturing industry, and the agriculture and transportation sectorsResearch field candidatesThe Department of Mechanical Engineering of the TUe seeks to hire an outstanding tenuretrack assistant professor in the field of Multiphysics Dynamical System Design, which should play a leading role in addressing these challenges and trends in the abovementioned areasEducationThe candidate will contribute to the existing BSc program Mechanical Engineering and the MSc programs Mechanical Engineering ME and Systems and Control SC within the departmentEmbeddingThe candidates group will initially be embedded in existing groups in the Department, in particular the groups within the sections of Dynamics and Control andor Control Systems Technology The department fosters a personnel strategy stimulating personal growth towards faculty forming independent groups within larger coherent sectionsThe Department of Mechanical Engineering currently seeks to hire three tenuretrack assistant professors with a focus on Engineering Design, each with an individual disciplinary emphasis, one on Dynamical Systems and Control, related to the above profile, one on Energy and Flow and one on Materials and Mechanics The candidate is expected to develop an independent profile while actively seeking collaboration with the other faculty focusing on engineering design aspects and contributing to the building of a multidisciplinary engineering design teamThe candidates group will be embedded in the HighTech Systems Institute within the University The group will also be embedded in research schools of the Dutch Institute of Systems and Control DISC and Engineering Mechanics EMFunction ElementsOffer Requirements","Employment
