4,electricity,Indeed,p_c1fd8ad449d23d76,CONSULTANT INTERNATIONAL ENERGY,Magnus, Naarden,"Do you enjoy working on projects and are you looking for an international working environment where you will experience a steep learning curve? We have a spot for you in our energy team! Magnus Red is looking for a Consultant International Energy to work on complex projects in the European Electricity Market. Do you want to make an impact? Keep reading!

WHAT WILL YOU DO?

As a Consultant for the International Energy Sector you support project teams that work on the integration of the European electricity market. These teams need to define and design the international cooperation by e.g. developing methods, processes, IT and contracts. Eventually, these processes of different electricity organisations in Europe need to come together, which is a huge challenge.

Your role? You are the Project Management Officer (PMO), the independent driving force of these teams. You guide them in their process to achieve results and solutions despite the large differences between the organisations, their different interests and ways of working. From a neutral position you ensure that decisions are made and progress is achieved. Often you add value by proposing new solutions where necessary and feasible. We call this business diplomacy, which is used to achieve consensus between the different stakeholders. Primarily, you are also a project manager, who offers structure and clarity and follows-up on actions and deadlines.

You will learn a lot while working on different disciplines and challenges, perfect for someone who graduated recently and who wants to make an impact.

WHAT DO WE OFFER?

Why choose Magnus Red? We offer a stimulating working environment: a young and international team of about 40 consultants and project managers. They are all motivated professionals who respect each other and want to learn from each other. No egos, but commitment and fun, also outside working hours.

We are there for you to help you grow. You learn most on the job, but we also offer an extensive training program. A program with internal and external trainings on the European Electricity Sector, project management and soft skills. Next to that, there are expectations and also a lot of room for your own ideas to keep improving our services. Sounds good?

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

You are an analytical young professional who combines organisational skills with knowledge of people and a drive to deliver results! In addition, the following profile matches you:

Master’s degree in a technical, science, business or international relations direction with excellent grades;
0 to 3 years working experience; project management experience is valuable;
Proven international experience in which you have demonstrated your organisational talent and facilitating skills;
Interesting secondary activities that show you that you have an entrepreneurial mindset and take the initiative;
Strong communication: you mobilise people with all kinds of backgrounds and your English is excellent (great if you speak several European languages);
Analytically strong: of course you are smart, but you are also structured and able to think ahead;
And also demonstrably interested in the European energy sector! It is a plus if you already have some experience.
WHO ARE WE?

Start Making A Difference is what working at Magnus Red entails. To have a direct impact on challenging projects, that is what we want. Our fast growing team of consultants work on national and international projects at various clients in energy, media, retail and e-commerce sectors. In order to achieve excellent results, we always want to get the best out of ourselves – and each other. Your professional and personal growth is top priority! You get an extra boost through Young Red. Together with other young professionals you share experiences, follow training courses and organize social events.

As an installations worker you start on the first monday of january. Why so early in the year?

That makes the job so much fun and not a day will be the same. After everything is installed and the campsites are opening, you will be responsible for the reperations at the campsites. For example when a fridge will break down at an accommodation where guests are staying. Ofcourse it's important that the reperations will be done as soon as possible. Together with your other colleagues at the campsites, you will make sure that the guests have an experience that they will never forget. Your workinglocation will be Italy.

Boldly coloring outside the lines of luxury, W turns the traditional notion of the extravagant hotel on its head. Our irreverent attitude and taste for excess redefine revelry for the modern jet set. Our guests have a lust for a life less ordinary that drives them to demand more, experience it all, and hit repeat.

We share our guests’ passions, providing insider access to what’s new and what’s next. Moderation is not in our vocabulary and we know that lust for life demands more, not less. W guests soak it in and live each day with a mantra: Detox.Retox.Repeat. If you’re ready to create the energetic W scene that is magnetic to everyday disruptors around the world, then we invite you to explore a career with W Hotels.

Boldly coloring outside the lines of luxury, W turns the traditional notion of the extravagant hotel on its head. Our irreverent attitude and taste for excess redefine revelry for the modern jet set. Our guests have a lust for a life less ordinary that drives them to demand more, experience it all, and hit repeat.

We share our guests’ passions, providing insider access to what’s new and what’s next. Moderation is not in our vocabulary and we know that lust for life demands more, not less. W guests soak it in and live each day with a mantra: Detox.Retox.Repeat.

systems, the internetofthings with millions of users and sensors, all generate enormous amounts of data and it is not always clear how to gather, process, and analyze that data in an efficient and rigorous manner Data science provides a solution to this problem It basically yields a set of tools for data mining, data cleansing, machine learning and data analysis, , While these tools can tackle a wide variety of problems, computer science approaches often ignore the structure that is present in the problem due to the physics This structure could come from the prior knowledge of the model that generates the data eg, radio frequency channel models, biomedical signal models, diffusion models, or it could directly relate to the structure in the data eg, spacetime, sparsity, networkgraph data Taking such structure into account will aid many of the existing data science tools, making them easier to interpret and simpler to implement This field of structured data science is shaped by the nontrivial interplay between conventional signal processing and conventional data science The goal is to illuminate and explore this interplay and apply it to the earlier mentioned applications, ,

looking for a highly motivated candidate to work on the interdisciplinary project Statistical mechanics problems on random graphs in collaboration with two of the groups of Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics DIAM, ie the Applied Probability group and the Mathematical Physics group, The research work for the prospective PhD candidate focusses on metastability for spins models on random graphs, both from the perspective of theoretical probability and numerical simulations, The theory of random graphs has attracted great interest in the last years due to their application to realworld networks In the present project we will study different types pf spin systems on the ErdosRenyi random graph and investigate their dynamical properties with a special focus on metastability Systems subject to random dynamics exhibit metastability when they persist for a very long time in a phase called metastable state that is different from the one corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium called stable state The main goal in studying metastability is then to give a precise estimate of the mean transition time from the metastable state to the stable state, The approach used in our research is twofold For the theoretical probability part we will work with potential theory, which has proved to be extremely successful in computing hitting times of Markov processes For the simulations part we will employ MonteCarlo computations using Metropolisbased algorithms, , In addition to the research work, the student is expected to teach 40 of the work load, , , , , , , , offers

betterunderstood metalanguage There is no shortage of metalanguages that can be used to implement definitional interpreters, but existing metalanguages do not strike a satisfactory balance between declarativity, executability, and verifiability Executability and efficiency typically comes at the cost of sacrificing declarativity and verifiability, and vice versa The proposed PhD project revolves around the development of a new language for defining languages that addresses this shortcoming The vision is to provide a framework and tool that generates efficient language run times from declarative and verifiable language definitions The goal of the PhD project is to contribute to this vision, , , , , , Recent work on scopesandframes introduced a set of memory primitives for implementing lexical name binding such as binders in  calculus, and nonlexical name binding such as module imports, class inheritance, etc, , But, to date, scopesandframes have not been integrated into any definition language that strikes a balance between the concerns above, , , There are several research objectives that could be explored as part of this project For example, , , , , We are looking for a versatile candidate who can contribute to the development of theoretical foundations, design of metalanguages, implementation and integration of languages and libraries in the language workbench, and evaluate the new techniques in language design case studies, For more information see the publications on scope graphs For this project see especially the ESOP15, ECOOP16, POPL18, and

213,electricity,LinkedIn,2305935816,Postdoctoral position in “Cyber Resilience of Future Power Grids using Blockchain Technology”,Technische Universiteit Delft,"Delft, South Holland, Netherlands","Job Description, , The Intelligent Electrical Power Grids IEPG section within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at TU Delft has a very ambitious and diversified research programme covering major technological challenges concerning the operation and planning of future power grids IEPG is expanding the research programme on cyber security and resilience of power grids to cyber attacks The postdoctoral candidate is expected to conduct research on blockchainbased cyber security to improve the resilience of future power systems with high shares of Distributed Energy Resources DERs This position is funded by the Delft Blockchain Lab DBL, httpswwwtudelftnldelftblockchainlab, which is the initiative that brings all blockchainrelated research at together, , Current Practice The electric distribution network that prevails all over the world follows a centuryold topdown structure This is centrally operated by Distribution System Operators DSOs, which monitor and control the high and medium voltage networks Typically, the Low Voltage LV network is not observable High shares of DERs are deployed at all voltage levels in the distribution network to tackle climate change and reduce our carbon footprint However, the distribution network currently lacks the necessary cyber security and resilience to prevent cyber attacks on DERs, grid edge devices, and associated electricity infrastructure, , Problem Description The increased grid digitalisation has brought forth cyber attacks and threats as major risks Cyber attacks on power grids are a real modernday threat, as shown by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016 More recently, nineteen zeroday vulnerabilities have been identified in a widely used industrial TCPIP stack, dubbed Ripple20 The Ripple20 investigations demonstrate Internet of Things IoTbased vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to gain access to and modify critical Operational Technology OT and IoT networked components This poses a major threat to the future power grid with high shares of OT and IoTenabled DERs Cyber attacks are becoming more advanced and focused, bypassing networklevel protection to target specific industrial IoT devices Coordinated and simultaneous cyber attacks on aggregated DERs can have a large impact on power system stability, which may cause cascading failures and a blackout The grid edge is becoming too shaky to shield with traditional defences Smart grid cyber security is needed to protect every digital interaction between DERs and grid operators in the LV network An increasingly open and transactional grid edge stresses the need to enforce the smart grid defences with blockchain, , , , What is needed from you The postdoctoral candidate will develop blockchain cyber security technology to help secure distributed energy resources at the grids edge with the overall aim to improve cyber security and grid resilience to cyber attacks More specifically, you will develop advanced monitoring, control, and communication frameworks for embedded DERs enabled through blockchain to further build the foundation for a decarbonised, digitalised, and decentralised grid, while making it more resilient from a cyber security perspective Blockchain provides a highly structured and immutable audit trail, complete with the identity of every actor in the cyberphysical system It offers enhanced capabilities to verify the integrity of measurements and control setpoints for DERs and detect any data alteration by attackers This makes the grid edge cyber resilient The expected outcome is a distributed, scalable, and cyber secure architecture using blockchain technology that enables visibility, control, and security of grid edge DERs with the required speed and scale The outcome of this research directly contributes to the cyber resilience of future power systems with high shares of OT  IoTenabled DERs, , The candidate has a PhD in computer science, mathematics, electrical engineering or a similar discipline and experience in blockchain technology eg, hyperledger and cyberphysical security, , , , Salary and benefits are in
