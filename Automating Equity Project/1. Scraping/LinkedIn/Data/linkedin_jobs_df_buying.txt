At Dan, we work, grow and build fast. Shaking up the industry and making a splash. We’re dreamers who roll up their sleeves and do the work. And transparency is our thing.

We think being kind is cool. That’s why we uplift instead of compete against each other. Unless we’re playing FIFA or frisbee.

As Account Manager you will play a key role at Dan.com. We act as the bridge between our product and our users. By helping them every day, we gain valuable insights and push new ideas to shape Dan's ever-changing product roadmap.

Proactively ensure the stability of Dan’s major functions and systems in seamless collaboration with developers.
Collaborate within and outside of your team to support broader business objectives.
Lead or participate in projects to improve our internal team or external company processes.
What you’ll bring
1-3 years of experience in a customer facing role in the tech or hospitality industry. SaaS or domaining experience is a huge plus
Be fluent in English. Any other European or Asian language would be a huge advantage
Ability to troubleshoot problems, find answers to customer issues, and articulate complex solutions in written communication
Plus: Experience in working cross-functionally on a daily basis. Being the bridge that connects the users with the rest of internal teams (Brand, Product, etc)
Plus: Able to bring dad-jokes to the table.
Psst … some added perks
Top notch equipment
Free lunch and healthy snacks, every day. Yup, you read that right!
Friday after-work drinks at the office
Company and team outings (from dinners and paintball to gaming and movie nights — and everything in between)
A game room for our Fifa tournaments
A team of (fast-)forward-thinking, talented and fun colleagues from all over the world!

57,buying,Indeed,p_309a26b7a211360f,UX Writer,Dancom, Amsterdam West,"About us

Buying a domain name is needlessly complicated. And selling domains? Not much easier.

So we started Dan! The no-nonsense domain trading platform.

We’re on a mission to make domain name trading available to everyone. Easy, fast and secure. And, most importantly: transparently. Because we believe transparency is the key to a better domain world. That’s why we do what we say. And we say what we do.

How we work

From our industry-improving products to our videogame competitions, our company culture is busy, productive and fun.

At Dan, we work, grow and build fast. Shaking up the industry and making a splash. We’re dreamers who roll up their sleeves and do the work. And transparency is our thing.

We think being kind is cool. That’s why we uplift instead of compete against each other. Unless we’re playing FIFA or frisbee.

The role: UX Writer

You will be our first in-house UX Writer and be joining the newly formed and growing Product Design team. In order to give our customers an experience they can’t get enough of, we depend on our writers to craft copy that educates and empowers our customers. Whether it’s product copy or creating compelling storytellings to bring our brand to life, our Product Design team is responsible for pushing it forward.

You’ll not only work within the Product Design Team and Product division to define the language, and strategic messaging for our products. With your fellow creatives, you’ll develop and expand copy that expresses Dan’s unique brand voice and communicates the benefits and functionality of our products and features in a meaningful way.

In return, you’ll gain access to one of the most fun, open, and ambitious groups of people working in Amsterdam. We push each other to be our absolute best and are the kind of company that will make you feel happy getting out of bed every morning.

This role reports to the Head of Brand & Design and is located in beautiful Amsterdam.
What you’ll do
Write, write, write. Consistently bring Dan’s brand voice and messaging to life in your writing, combining storytelling and narrative with feature and product details
Anticipate our customers and business needs, advocate for our users and ensure that the final copy surprises and delights them.
Help define, maintain and push forward Dan's voice and tone guidelines, seeding throughout the organization to get everyone excited and informed about the voice.
Push beyond ‘just microcopy.’ Regularly try (and fail) to use new ways of structuring, designing, and explaining content to improve the user experience.
What you’ll bring
5+ years of copywriting experience at a brand or tech company (SAAS a major plus)
You’re highly skilled in adapting the English language. You can write the same idea 20 ways, and you know exactly which 19 versions to toss out.
You know every rule of writing, but you care more about how people actually interact with language in combination with digital design.
Your experience proves that you are excited by complexity. You thrive when breaking down ubiquitous tech-speak (technical jargon) into compelling microcopy.
You always have a backlog of creative ideas on hand but can focus on what will be most impactful.
Would be as mortified as Cersei Lannister during her walk of shame if they saw content go out with a grammatical or spelling error and would take action swiftly to make corrections in real-time.
Regularly laugh at the copy you write.
Psst … some added perks
Top notch equipment
Free lunch and healthy snacks, every day. Yup, you read that right!
Friday after-work drinks at the office
Company and team outings (from dinners and paintball to gaming and movie nights — and everything in between)
A game room for our Fifa tournaments
A team of (fast-)forward-thinking, talented and fun colleagues from all over the world!
Are you interested?

If you think you’re a match for this role and can bring some great skills to the Dan team, please apply! We’re excited to get to know you.

Please note that applications without a cover letter and portfolio (attachment or online) will not be considered (this is a writing position, after all).

Our Backend Engineering Story
Our development team is responsible for stability, reliability, and versatility of Catawiki's platform. We are building new and exciting product features to craft an engaging platform, where our users can offer and discover special objects. At the same time, we are moving the platform towards a microservices architecture by gradually dismantling a Ruby on Rails monolith.

Here's Nathalia, one of our Engineers:
""I joined Catawiki looking for new challenges in my career and after 1 year I still feel that I am growing every day. Migrating to microservices can sound just like creating new APIs and databases, but every migration is different and brings new problems to be solved. I am proud of our achievements after every project, thanks to the brilliant people that we have in the company, the friendly environment, and the freedom to experiment and learn from it.""

So what's the job
Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform.
Along with other members of the Development team, you will build scalable microservices while measuring and monitoring system performance. In addition, you will use experimentation, backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.

How we roll - Our Stack
As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a market, which brings a lot of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, written in Ruby and some of them in Go, to handle the high volume served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, delivering code to production multiple times a day, A/B testing every assumption, making mistakes, learning from them, and iterating quickly.

You'll move in sync
You will be part of a team focused on a particular domain within Catawiki and contribute your ideas and efforts to grow the business and innovate the product. Each team is usually composed of Frontend, Backend, and Mobile Developers together with a Product Owner, a UX Designer and a Data Scientist.

A little about you
It doesn't matter what stack you're used to working with, as long as you're motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby, so if you are not experienced in it, it will be highly valued that you're passionate about learning new technologies.

Next to this:
You have experience in designing, developing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on users.

Our Android Story

At Catawiki, we keep our users close to our hearts and make sure that we deliver a great user experience across all platforms. Android is no exception! As an Android developer working at Catawiki, you are empowered to take full ownership of the features we deliver and full ownership on how we structure our code base.
We embrace change, we've migrated from MVC to MVP and now to MVVM. Currently, we are adopting Kotlin and enjoying all the cool advantages that come with it. We are constantly improving our architecture, making it fun and challenging at the same time.

Here's Ahmed, one of our Engineers:

""It is so inspiring to have been a part of Catawiki's journey and to see how the company has grown and continues to do so. We're always aiming to improve our products of which our Android App is, of course, a big part of. To do so, I collaborate on a daily basis with Backenders, Product Owners and Designers to find the best way to implement features technically, as well as visually. We have come a long way since the birth of our Android App, and we still have a long way to go, but we are excited and motivated to continue improving and learning along the way"".


So what's the job?

Here at Catawiki, you will have a huge impact, working in a data-driven way to add value to the business along with the other 6 members of the Android team. You will add your own expertise to further grow our business, experiment and innovate the product.

You'll be adding new features to create an even greater experience for our users. As well as actively collaborating with your fellow Android Developers to take the codebase and the entire Android App to the next level. Our millions of users will thank you for that!


How we roll - Our Stack

Our codebase is primarily written in Java but we are strongly adopting Kotlin for our new features and refactorings. Our app uses MVVM as a general architecture, and we rely heavily on the reactive/functional paradigm using RxJava. We also make use of Android's Architecture Components. We are using the most popular stuff like Dagger 2, Retrofit, data binding, as well as Mockito and Espresso for testing.


You'll move in sync
You will be part of one of the Product teams, working on a given domain (Search & Discovery, Payments, Onboarding etc.) and you will work closely with all of the team members (Front-End, Back-End, UX and Data) in sharing your expertise and explaining how the things you do will affect the user experience.


A little about you
You are a passionate experienced Android Developer with a strong eye for detail.
You strive to be a great team player and don't shy away from new challenges.
You are comfortable in a startup environment and are ready to jump in and help if needed.
You keep the company's values close to your heart and enjoy being in a diverse environment.

We expect you to have experience with:

Strong Object-oriented programming skills - priority
Strong knowledge of the Android framework
Knowledge of the reactive/functional paradigm

You'll move in sync

Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby, so if you are not experienced in it, it will be highly valued that you're passionate about learning new technologies.

Buying a domain name is needlessly complicated. And selling domains? Not much easier.
So we started Dan! The no-nonsense domain trading platform.

We are all driven by one ethos: Get Shit Done. We love shaping things together and leveraging different perspectives, because that makes our products better. Our people are empowered with freedom and opportunity; in return, we expect honesty, courage, and agility. We own our work, and sometimes we fail. And then we get back up and cross the finish line — together as a team. Sound refreshing? We think so, too.

The role: Software Developer

You take ownership and lead the building of (user facing) features. Shipping often is important to you and you see things through to the end.
Craft product experiences that seamlessly bridge multiple touchpoints, from desktop to mobile interfaces.
Help maintain a strong and future proof code language and continually raise our bar for quality.

You have 5+ years of experience and a strong track record of working with Ruby on Rails as a Senior Developer
You are comfortable with JavaScript and popular frameworks like React
You are familiar with front-end principles and a keen eye for design
You are experienced practicing Behavior Driven Development
You prefer a large structured monolith over small microservices
You uphold best practices in developing, security, and performance
You have full (professional) proficiency in English, both verbally and written
Plus: Experience with front-end build systems like Webpack

Plus: Experience with handling continuous growth and mass scale

Company and team outings (from dinners and paintball to gaming and movie nights — and everything in between)

121,buying,Indeed,p_a5cde59d83ae3987,Software Engineer (Team Agents),Funda, Amsterdam,"Funda is on the lookout for amazing developers to join our team. If you want a job that is impactful, modern and touches the lives of everyone in the Netherlands, this is it. You will write code that gets viewed 77 million times per month, be involved in one of the biggest decisions in people’s lives—buying somewhere to live—and you will actively participate in ideas on how to make this journey better.

Your job

We’re looking for someone to help strengthen what we call the makelaars (agents) teams. Since funda is a marketplace, it has two big parts, supply and demand. The makelaars teams take care of our customers who mostly work on the supply part. In your general day to day job you would probably write code in C# (latest .net core) that will get deployed several times a day to our Kubernetes cluster hosted in Azure. You might have to find out how to refactor some legacy code or deep-dive into some business logic that nobody remembers anymore.

Since quality is very important to us, the code you write is generally unit tested and written with DDD in the back of your mind. You might get tagged in a couple of PRs that you need to review, or you might need to test something for a colleague. All the code we ship is tested in one way or another. We have frontenders who specialize in frontend but you will be responsible for the backend. Some of the problems you might solve are “How do I extract this old logic into microservices while being iterative in my approach?” or “How can I make my awesome team even better?” If things like the 12-factor app, clean architecture, DDD or Event Driven Architecture get your fingers tingling with excitement, then get in touch!

Your team

As a Software Engineer, you will be part of a Scrum team, consisting of a Product Owner, UX Designer, multiple Engineers and an Agile Tester. Together, you will focus on an area of expertise. There will be plenty of room for new ideas, experimentation, trial and error, and on-the-spot learning.


Your profile

You’re proactive, eager and results-driven. Due to your strong technical knowledge and enormous drive, you are the perfect addition to the team and you easily motivate others. Furthermore you recognize yourself in the following requirements:

You work and think like someone with a Bachelor/Master’s degree
You have a minimum of 5 years' experience in a similar job position
You have experience building (high-volume) professional-level website
You know how to work with Microservices, C#, Dotnet core 5 (latest version), Kubernetes and Microsoft azure
You have experience with agile working methods (we use Scrum)
Your work is testable

This is what we offer

Funda offers you one of the most challenging jobs in your field. Whether you work in the office or from home, we’ll make sure that funda feels like home to you. On location, you and your colleagues will work in the heart of Amsterdam, with our own ‘funda square’ and an unobstructed view of the IJ river. If you work from home, you’ll stay connected to your colleagues through Microsoft Teams, and we’ll make sure you’ve got everything you need for your home office.

You’ll be working with more than 140 great (international) minds, who will make you feel welcome from the start. To us, it’s only logical to take good care of our talents, and therefore of you. If you come to work with us, we offer you:

An excellent salary with an annual bonus scheme and 25 days off (you can buy more days if you need them).
Flexible working hours.
Reimbursements for your telephone, home internet, travel expenses, gym and part of your pension.
Heavenly chair massages 6 times a year (at the office, during working hours).
Chef-prepared fresh lunch every day (when you’re in the office), ranging from soups to salads, fresh bread rolls from the baker and a snack every Friday.
Dinners, team outings, drinks and a birthday present. And during lockdown periods, funda offers great virtual alternatives.
The opportunity to attend congresses and follow courses and classes, because at funda, we believe that learning never stops. You can also get your creative juices flowing during our hackathons.

Buying a domain name is needlessly complicated. And selling domains? Not much easier.

So we started Dan! The no-nonsense domain trading platform.
We’re on a mission to make domain name trading available to everyone. Easy, fast and secure. And, most importantly: transparently. Because we believe transparency is the key to a better domain world. That’s why we do what we say. And we say what we do.

How we work

We work fast, grow fast, and build fast. Life at Dan moves in fast-forward motion. We’re a team that focuses on making an impact — right from day one. We are go-getters, industry leaders, and dreamers. Risk takers. Roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-it-happen kind of people. We thrive on transparency, and we value solution-minded attitudes.
We are all driven by one ethos: Get Shit Done. We love shaping things together and leveraging different perspectives, because that makes our products better. Our people are empowered with freedom and opportunity; in return, we expect honesty, courage, and agility. We own our work, and sometimes we fail. And then we get back up and cross the finish line — together as a team. Sound refreshing? We think so, too.

The role: Software Developer

Software Developers play a big role in our Product Team. With your fellow developers, you'll develop, maintaining and expand our product design systems and frameworks in a highly collaborative environment where everyone’s input is valued.
Our product teams have the freedom and authority to create impactful products to empower both our internal and external users. We use an agile development methodology, meaning we deploy code multiple times per day while ensuring our applications are rigorously tested and statically analyzed.
In return, you’ll gain access to one of the most fun, open, and ambitious groups of people working in Amsterdam. We push each other to be our absolute best and are the kind of company that will make you feel happy getting out of bed every morning.
What you’ll do
Collaborate with other designers, developers, and users to develop simple, elegant flows and interfaces that help solve complex user problems.
You take ownership and lead the building of (user facing) features. Shipping often is important to you and you see things through to the end.
Craft product experiences that seamlessly bridge multiple touchpoints, from desktop to mobile interfaces.
Help maintain a strong and future proof code language and continually raise our bar for quality.
What you’ll bring
You have 2+ years of experience and a strong track record of working with Ruby on Rails as a Medior Developer
You are comfortable with JavaScript and popular frameworks like React
You are familiar with front-end principles and a keen eye for design
You are experienced practicing Behavior Driven Development
You prefer a large structured monolith over small microservices
You uphold best practices in developing, security, and performance
You have full (professional) proficiency in English, both verbally and written
Plus: Experience with front-end build systems like Webpack
Plus: Experience with Sys-ops experience (AWS)
Plus: Experience with handling continuous growth and mass scale
Psst … some added perks
Top notch equipment
Free lunch and healthy snacks, every day. Yup, you read that right!

146,buying,Indeed,p_9f81b1245eb2be3d,DevOps Engineer,Search X Recruitment, Amsterdam,"Customer is king. We all know it. Especially nowadays, in the age of the internet. Your wildest dreams are just a click away with the ‘add to shopping cart’ button. All we really need now is for it all to work smoothly, reliably, consistently and at scale. Sounds easy? Great, then you’re the person we’re looking for.
Tell me more…
With the global rise of E-commerce and a whole host of new media platforms that can be used to sell products, buying a product has never been so complex. Back in the days you would simply go to a store, grab a product, drop some money on the counter and that was that. Nowadays, there are more stores than you can count, selling more products than you can imagine, and offering more payment options than you can fathom. Selling a product is infinitely more complex than it used to be.
Fortunately, there’s one company working to make buying stuff, easy again. By combining one of the world’s leading marketing agencies with one of the world’s leading digital agencies, it has become the one-stop-shop for all things e-commerce. From developing marketing campaigns and analyzing customer data, to building a completely new E-commerce platform - they do it all.
Great, so what do they need from me?
They need your help to make sure it all runs, and keeps running. Because you’re all about automation and orchestration. You know how to keep an extensive and complex cloud-based infrastructure in check, while also supporting the developers who are constantly trying to make your work harder.
We know it sounds a little abstract but that’s because the role is so diverse. From helping a major sneaker brand completely redesign their E-commerce platform to service millions of customers, to maintaining the advanced analytics environment where all the customer data is analyzed.
Sounds cool but what can I bring?
It almost goes without saying that a few years of solid DevOps experience will come in handy. As will experience with most modern CI/CD tools. Tools like Jenkins, Ansible, Chef and Puppet. Even infrastructure provisioning tools like CloudFormation or Terraform. The most important thing, however, is your ability to communicate.
Awesome, that’s me! But do I also get paid?
Of course, you do. You’ll be handsomely rewarded for your hard work. Starting with a base salary up to €5500 gross a month and excellent secondary benefits. So what are you waiting for?

Senior fullstack developer

Two commercially minded men have joined forces in 2013 with the idea that buying a razor blade did not have to be as expensive and complicated as it was back then. They found the price to high and the service you got in return was disproportionate. So they came with a better idea and in a short time, the idea was rolled out into a success formula that has been the subject of several television advertisements on a daily basis. Their company is based on the 5th floor in a newly renovated building, close to the Olympic stadium. A nice extra is their huge roof terrace where the sun shines until the late hours. The spacious layout with glass walls makes it looks as if all 30 employees from different departments are directly connected. However, you notice that IT is very important for the company since Development is located centrally in the building.

Customer service is in this company of highest importance. They try to outperform direct competitors on all kinds of fronts. For example, the price of the blades is often half the price you pay for other brands. You also do not have to go to the shop, but you can indicate when and how often you want the knives delivered to your home. The packaging is environmentally friendly and the blades are recycled which gives them an edge.

In a relatively short period of time, the company has grown enormously. They just raised 10 million euros for the coming year 2020.
Their mission is: 'We want to become the best friend of the man in the bathroom.’ Therefore they will expand their product range with four new products that will soon be on the market. Internationally, they are growing all the time. The market is also being taken over outside Europe. This is preceded by an enormous technical planning where they are looking for experienced Developers who can think along with the current Developers. Besides the Developers, they also use an external digital agency that helps build the platform with them. Currently, they are working together on optimizing the API so that all supply chains can be easily applied.

The current team consists of 3 PHP developers, 2 front-end developers and the Lead Developer. Now that the next step will be taken within the company, it is important that more technical knowledge is brought in-house. For this reason they are in need of a senior fullstack developer that can support and improve their internal design system, UI components library and back-end. Design for the website/email promotional campaigns and analyse metrics and conversions. Write code and develop to help them building their new solutions. The right candidate will learn and improve his coding skill every day. The front end part of the platform is built with Vue in the back-end they use Laravel.

The Lead Developer is Romanian so it is important that you have a good command of the English language. Because of the increasing brand awareness, more will be expected of you in terms of professionalism in your work. So you can handle pressure well and take responsibility for your work. Everything is being professionalized, so methods like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are concepts that you understand.

Do you love architecture, design, lots of creative freedom and working with Kotlin (can be learned here!), GCP and Kubernetes?
How about getting all the benefits of working for a lean and mean start-up, but under the protected wings of a super financial healthy mother company with big clients, resources, great benefits, knowledge and office facilities?

Then wait no longer, this is your job!

Your employer: Building some of the most performance online technology the world has ever seen!

Online has always been an ever-growing market and due to the global situation, this has only led to even more insane growth! For years this energetic Amsterdam based tech company has capitalized on this development by helping their clients maximize the potential of online.

Their culture is one that is driven by curiosity, innovation, continuous learning (big training budgets and facilities), passion for quality, and fun! As they are middle-sized you are big enough to work with amazing clients and really make an impact, but still small enough that you feel you are part of something special and you can build strong relationships with all of your colleagues. Year on year they have been growing successfully!

They are now gearing up for further success by building their very own online technology platform, which will be processing over half a billion requests per day!

The rest you can work your magic on, with deciding the architecture, choosing the stack, build the MVP and then develop that platform into maturity.

As the product grows you will also be able to help grow the team and even grow into the role of tech lead if you would so wish!

What is required?
A minimum of 5 years of professional backend development experience
Solid experience with one or more JVM languages
Experience with architecture, design of reliable, high throughput server-side applications
Solid comprehension of data structures and algorithms

Obviously, the bar is still standing and open on Friday’s (true story)!About usThe retail landscape is rapidly changing. We believe that independent stores can differentiate themselves from the masses by creating a curated product offering. Reinforced by the ‘maker revolution’, there are more brands than ever before. However, there remains many inefficiencies with the current wholesale model, making it difficult for brands to find the right sales channels, and for retailers to discover unique products. We want to enable creators and shop owners from around the world to come together and build upon one another's success.We make wholesale better. On a daily basis, we find unique brands and use machine learning to connect them with the right retailers. We take the guesswork out of the equation by unlocking the power of data for all. Leveraging our social platform to create interactions between both parties, our mission translates two-fold: 1) retailers can easily discover and purchase distinctive and high quality products in smaller quantities and; 2) brands can quickly do business with new buyers in new regions. With our vision to provide unique merchandise for every store, we seek to help both retailers and brands grow their business.Entrepreneurship and commerce is in our DNA; that is why we set out to build this product for our customers.

Our Backend Engineering Story
Our development team is responsible for stability, reliability, and versatility of Catawiki's platform. We are building new and exciting product features to craft an engaging platform, where our users can offer and discover special objects. At the same time, we are moving the platform towards a microservices architecture by gradually dismantling a Ruby on Rails monolith.

So what's the job

Catawiki's promise to users is that we'll help them find the objects they love, and then we'll take care of the rest. That means that our auctions are 100% curated by experts, we speak the same language as our users, we make shipping smooth and easy, and most importantly, the payment is always safe with us!


As a key player in our Payments team, you'll be optimizing our platform and developing new features that allow us to improve how we accept money from buyers (Pay-In) and deliver money to our sellers (Pay-Out). Payments is the backbone of our marketplace so your work will have a huge impact in delivering our promise of being a robust, reliable and delightful platform.


How we roll - Our Stack
As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a market, which brings a lot of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, written in Ruby and some of them in Go, to handle the high volume served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, delivering code to production multiple times a day, A/B testing every assumption, making mistakes, learning from them, and iterating quickly.

You'll move in sync with

The Payments team will be involved in projects that will have a big impact on the company and you'll work closely with our other core teams such as Logistics, Shipping, Fulfilment, Finance, Tax & legal.


A little about you


The Payments team is looking for people that like to make a big impact, and love the challenge of working on one of the most highly used and high traffic parts of our platform. We love people who want to make a contribution to further building out our engineering culture and who want to have some fun along the way.


Next to this:

You have some experience in a project or application related to Finance, FinTech or Payments.
You have experience in designing, developing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and scalability.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on users.
We primarily use Ruby and Go on the Back-End, but language isn't as important to us as someone with a great understanding of Engineering best practices.

The Catawiki Story
A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every single day. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone.
In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent.
Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 International offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

Here's what we can offer you
A diverse and international team with over 40 different nationalities, located in the heart of Amsterdam and Assen with an easy-going atmosphere.
The Catawiki Community gathers everyone together for everything from 'CataFooty' to International Food Festivals, Friday Drinks, Board Game Nights, Pub Quizzes and Boot Camps!
And there's more! We also provide paid holidays, holiday allowance and a pension plan paid for by Catawiki.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you've got a story to tell, come and join us.


Covid-19 and hiring

Our Backend Engineering Story
Our development team is responsible for stability, reliability, and versatility of Catawiki's platform. We are building new and exciting product features to craft an engaging platform, where our users can offer and discover special objects. At the same time, we are moving the platform towards a microservices architecture by gradually dismantling a Ruby on Rails monolith.

So what's the job

Catawiki's promise to users is that we'll help them find the objects they love, and then we'll take care of the rest. That means that our auctions are 100% curated by experts, we speak the same language as our users, we make shipping smooth and easy, and most importantly, the payment is always safe with us!

Payments is the backbone of our marketplace so your work will have a huge impact in delivering our promise of being a robust, reliable and delightful platform.


How we roll - Our Stack
As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a market, which brings a lot of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, written in Ruby and some of them in Go, to handle the high volume served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, delivering code to production multiple times a day, A/B testing every assumption, making mistakes, learning from them, and iterating quickly.

The Catawiki Story
A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every single day. As Europe's fastest growing online auction platform, our mission is to make special objects available to everyone.
In fact, 14 million users are buying and selling on Catawiki every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent.
Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 as a platform where collectors could manage their collections online. Yet, times change, ideas evolve, and in 2011 we hosted our first online auction and we haven't looked back since! We've now grown to 500 Catawikians working across 7 International offices and are proud to have maintained our start-up mentality.

Here's what we can offer you
A diverse and international team with over 40 different nationalities, located in the heart of Amsterdam and Assen with an easy-going atmosphere.
The Catawiki Community gathers everyone together for everything from 'CataFooty' to International Food Festivals, Friday Drinks, Board Game Nights, Pub Quizzes and Boot Camps!
And there's more! We also provide paid holidays, holiday allowance and a pension plan paid for by Catawiki.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you've got a story to tell, come and join us.


Covid-19 and hiring

That's why the entire recruitment process will take place remotely, using phone and video calls.
