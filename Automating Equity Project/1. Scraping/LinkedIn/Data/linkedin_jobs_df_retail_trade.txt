﻿Liever in het Nederlands solliciteren? Solliciteer dan op de functie van Casinomedewerker!
De functie
As a real pro in hospitality, you absolutely enjoy pleasing your guests. Today you have a morning shift; early out of bed. Fortunately, you get a free evening in return!
Together with your colleagues, you prepare everything for opening the casino. Often, familiar faces are already waiting for the casino to open; of course, you recognise them immediately. You welcome new guests and take them around the casino while informing them about our games.
During the entire day, you and your colleagues take care of our guests and make sure they will have everything they need. In the meantime, you make sure that everything looks tip-top. Most important is that you pamper your guests and treat them like real VIPs. This means that you tell them everything about the ins and outs of their game and about our drives, and that you know how to chat in a friendly manner with them.
If someone wins something, that of course calls for a celebration and that’s what you do! But also if someone is not so lucky at that moment, you know what to say and how you can best consol him. As a Casino Assistant, you can really make the difference, resulting in both new and existing guests wanting to come back to our casino.
The day just flies by! Tomorrow you will attend a training session about how you deal with difficult situations. No one day is the same at Jack’s Casino!
