FedEx Express is one of the world's largest express transportation companies and has consistently been selected as one of the top 10 World’s Most Admired Companies by ""Fortune"" magazine. Every day FedEx delivers for its customers with transportation and business solutions, serving more than 220 countries and territories around the globe. We can serve this global network due to our outstanding team of FedEx team members, who are tasked with making every FedEx experience outstanding.
Our Philosophy

FedEx takes care of our people; they, in turn, deliver the impeccable service demanded by our customers, who reward us with the profitability necessary to secure our future. The essential element in making the People-Service-Profit philosophy such a positive force for the company is where we close the circle, and return these profits back into the business, and invest back in our people. Our success in the industry is attributed to our people. Through our P-S-P philosophy, we have a work environment that encourages team members to be innovative in delivering the highest possible quality of service to our customers. We care for their well-being, and value their contributions to the company.
Our Culture

INKEF Capital is an innovative venture capital firm dedicated to supporting European early-stage companies in both the technology and healthcare/life sciences sectors. We are distinct from other funds in that our 20-year fund life and €500 million fund size allow us to be true a partner for the longer term, supporting ventures through their different stages of development.
With 12 investment professionals, the INKEF team has a multidisciplinary set of backgrounds in complementary technical and operational fields as well as geographies, which enables us to provide a rounded, international perspective and broad network to ensure that our portfolio companies reach their full global potential. Our fund has made over 40 investments across Europe and realized 6 exits resulting already in a top decile performance. Anticipating on our near term future expansion and ambitions, we are looking to expand the team further.

As a key next step in our journey, INKEF is looking to hire a Senior Associate to strengthen its technology team. We are looking for someone with passion for technology and keen interest in analyzing underlying architectures and evaluating companies’ technological choices, which forms a critical part of our investment decision. Moreover, the ideal candidate should be able to lead transactions largely autonomously and win the hearts of founders, while being able to secure the buy-in from senior members of the INKEF team. For exceptional candidates there will be a fast track perspective towards Principal level.

INKEF Capital is an innovative venture capital firm dedicated to supporting European early-stage companies in both the technology and healthcare/life sciences sectors. We are distinct from other funds in that our 20-year fund life and €500 million fund size allow us to be true a partner for the longer term, supporting ventures through their different stages of development.
With 12 investment professionals, the INKEF team has a multidisciplinary set of backgrounds in complementary technical and operational fields as well as geographies, which enables us to provide a rounded, international perspective and broad network to ensure that our portfolio companies reach their full global potential. Our fund has made over 40 investments across Europe and realized 6 exits resulting already in a top decile performance. Anticipating on our near term future expansion and ambitions, we are looking to expand the team further.

OUR TEAM
We now operate globally from offices in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Our employees work closely together in multidisciplinary teams, making our success possible.
Technology - At IMC, technology is not a department, it is at the heart of everything we do. Our technologists push the limits of possibility, and then look beyond. In our fast-paced environment, short feedback loops mean projects worked on in the morning can enter production the next day.
Trading – Although our traders come from many backgrounds they all have one thing in common: they are at their best solving complex problems. Their insight into global events, market shifts and pricing ensure we are trading in the right place, at the right time.
Business Support - Around the world, IMC’s business support teams are essential for sustaining our success. In our dynamic environment, we have many exciting challenges and multidisciplinary opportunities to shape our operations and make a real impact.
OUR CULTURE

Your ownership of the task continues until a working production release . Our most successful developers comfortably work in any part of our stack.
WHAT MAKES IT FUN?
One of the most fun aspects of the job is that we have a quick feedback loop. We release early and often to get incremental benefits as they are developed
We operate at the bleeding edge of technology. If something new can potentially bring an advantage we will actively invest in developing and utilizing the solution
We really believe in sharing knowledge and technology between the different offices. Much of our technology stack is shared between all 3 regions, and we provide opportunities to travel between the regions both for personal growth and to assist where it has the biggest impact.
To get the best results we encourage everybody to gain an understanding of both the trading strategy and how exchanges work on a technological level.
Working at IMC is also an opportunity to learn about financial markets . We know from experience that a lot of people really enjoy learning about a field beyond their immediate area of expertise, it’s one of the things that makes this job more interesting than others.
